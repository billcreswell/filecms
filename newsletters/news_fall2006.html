    <p>                    From The President's Desk<br />
      By Michael Geno</p>
    <p>     Congratulations on a fantastic  convention.  That seems to be the  response to our annual event this year held in Wyoming Michigan.  The First week end in October we hosted our  largest ever technology exhibition, while some of our activities were broadcast  over the internet.  More of our  convention highlights will be shared by others elsewhere in this  newsletter.  The remainder of my report  this time will consist of exurbs from the keynote address recorded at our  annual banquet October 7, 2006.  The  title of this message appeared in the convention program as follows.  &quot;who are the secret keepers, and what do  they know?  This Title was guaranteed to  bring a crowd!  I  hope those of you who could not celebrate  with us, will also find this message, well worth your time.</p>
    <p>                     MCBVI President Geno's<br />
      2006 Banquet Address</p>
    <p>     Everyone has secrets. How many of you came  here to see which of your secrets I may have discovered?  Fear of exposure, along with the temptation  to know all about the secrets others hide, can be irresistible.  Perhaps what I am about to comment on, will  bring satisfaction by confirming our suspicions.  But are we really like sharks ready to circle  round the scent of blood?  Someone told  me once that sharks will not attack lawyers   Because of professional curtesy.   But the only secrets I am prepared to share here, are my own, or ones  that are common to us all.</p>
    <p>     many issues competed for the attention of  this opportunity to communicate to our internet audience, as well as those  enjoying our Western style convention banquet.   Legislation continues to be drafted with language concerning the blind  that threaten our equal rights, and opportunities to positively influence programs  and services that impact us as a   minority.  Serious issues exposed  by the light of each annual resolution of the MCBVI, are being responded to by  a growing number of citizens.  One of our  goals is to help the general public realize that decisions involving the blind,  will impact the lives of all citizens.   Whenever, or wherever dignity, equality, and understanding of even one  among us is diminished, that loss must eventually settle as a burden on us all.</p>
    <p>     Society has begun to take note that Age  related vision loss is becoming a common concern.  Our local chapters, and state contact lines  are receiving calls every day with requests for help and information.  Through our efforts to respond, and in  interactions in support groups, it is alarming to witness how many seniors continue  driving blind on our roads and highways.   The slogan, &quot;Drive defensibly&quot; takes on more meaning for  travelers when they realize that a growing number of drivers licenses are still  in use years after aging adults become legally blind.  
      From warning signs, I have deduced who  these drivers are that experience the beginnings of serious sight loss.  Bouncing over curbs at corner turns, abrupt  stops and steering changes, and the blaring horns of other vehicles on the  road, are important clues to even sightless passengers.  Exposure to eminent danger can convene a very  important mental meeting in our mind if we choose to reflect on reality.  Many fear to face a new representative in  their mental meeting room.  Our own  personal mortality might seek the floor and begin to suggest difficult  truths.  Each of our responses to common realities  can be very different from person to person.   However, when truth is squarely dealt with, our approach to issues, and  life itself, will never be the same.</p>
    <p>     In today's multi media society, we have  passively witnessed the suggestion of our own mortality in TV and movie  programs.  News reports of gripping drama  move some beyond passive observation.  But  in the comfortable lives of far too many, the pain and grief of unexpected  disasters blazing before us, remain unreal.   Any suggestion of our own personal mortality may be too uncomfortable, and  for some, even morbid.  But I have  learned from my own experience, and from those who face their mortality every  day, life is richer, and relationships stronger after facing it.</p>
    <p>     You might begin by visiting those among us  who have already attended their meeting with mortality in nursing homes, cancer  treatment centers, or facilities offering hospice care.  Listening to individuals coping with these  conditions can open a new prospective on our own daily agenda.  During a visit to one of my closest friends,  we  frankly talked about life and death  issues.  Facing his terminal illness only  days before he died, he said to me, &quot;It seems such a contradiction.  Never before have I contemplated something  that is so certain, and uncertain at the same time.&quot;  After I gave the eulogy at his funeral, I was  struck by his continuing message to me.   Now, his silence seemed to unify all that he had listened to or  expressed during the brief 36 years of his life.  It was at that time I clearly understood in  his silence, the great man that he was.   I continue to grow in his brotherly love.  From experiences like these, I have learn to listened  to even the silence of those close to me.   Conversations with loved ones, seemed to have move deeper into my  thoughts, memories, and heart.</p>
    <p>     Eventually, the time will come when our  relationships with some while we live, must change with this ultimate  separation.   Our own meetings with mortality will  rearranged the furniture of our life agenda.</p>
    <p>     My personal agenda was again influenced by  this reality last December 27th, when I was told that I had cancer.  Like most of us, up to then I continued to  check my mortality at the door, convincing myself that I still have time.  Now, I had to consider this challenge to long  term plans and daily agendas.  When I was  next told last April that the surgery to remove this cancer, was not  successful, Mortality now boldly sat down at my mental meeting table.  Perhaps some of the minutes of my meetings  with mortality will interest you, and help you prepare your own agendas.</p>
    <p>     Something in me has awakened to deeper  experiences.  My sensitivity to even the  smallest blessing has been enhanced.  How  delicious is a Michigan apple, peach, or blueberry when you consider that this  might be the last one you will ever taste?   Each sensation leaves you cherishing the memory of similar blessings taken  for granted in the past.  The Uncertainty  my friend spoke of, is not all bad.  It  can open your mind to helpful questions.   Will this be the last chorus of Spring birds I will wake up to?  Are these the last piles of Fall leaves I  will hike through?  Will I be blessed to  see the next season of harvest, or holidays?   Should I contact every one I care about, and share how important they  are to me?<br />
      These questions and concerns are vivid  burning choices that demand our attention.   Mortality will make it very difficult to ignore them.  And when you do, the consequences can be so  painful.  The irony of contradiction my  close friend spoke of,  I now sense in  every bitter sweet action and relationship.<br />
      Just 8 weeks ago, I was suddenly nagged by  the idea of calling a friend and member of our Port Huron Blue Water League  chapter I had not spoken with since before my last surgery.  Medical priorities seemed to prevent us from  talking for several months.  She also had  recently been diagnosed with cancer, and the news about her washed like waves  on a beech.  In one report she would be doing  good, then in the next, she was too sick to call.  Sometimes the news would be days old, so I  would decide not to disturb her rest with a phone call.  Each opportunity to communicate never seemed  to conveniently open.  Finally, I felt in  my heart to just make a call anyway because I cared.  Maybe it was not a good time, but I could at  least express that much.  When her  daughter answered the phone, I was told that she was resting.  Then came this muffled conversation on the  other end of the line. Next I heard her say, &quot;Hello.&quot;  She was happy to hear from me, and we spent  time sharing again as members of our local chapter, and friends.  We talked about her attending our next  meeting, and traveling again with our group to next year's Winter Camp For The  Blind.  We warmed each other with our  memories of camaraderie and fun we all share at this annual camp sponsored by  Lions clubs.</p>
    <p>     I felt that she and I expressed much more  than plans and future hopes.  We tasted  the intensity of something that was not spoken.   In that intensity, we also affirmed how important is our brief time  together.  Each word, thought, and  laughter, seemed to be punctuated with our recognition of precious value.  She and I seemed to mutually understand that  this might be our last conversation.  Her  passing proved us right.  I am now  thankful that I didn't miss that special talk.   And I could have so easily made a simple decision to not make that  call.  Experiences like these have helped  me learn the impact of our simple choices, in the larger scheme of life.</p>
    <p>     &quot;there is always tomorrow, is a    Mythology of comfort and a delusion.  We expect that we will somehow avoid the  statistics that others experience in society.   XX per cent of persons die each year of heart attacks, auto accidents,  or other unforeseen events.  If you have  time to have the inevitable meeting with your own mortality, there will be a  complete shift in the importance of things.   Issues I once argued and fought over, grow trivial in comparison to  relationships.  Possessions I have  coveted and cherished seem to lose value.   Especially when compared with expressions of caring between people.  Now relationships can blaze with greater  light and heat.  Emotions run deeper,  washing away hurts and barriers to understanding.  What is trivial or burdensome can be forgiven,  opening our mind to more that is important.   This new prospective also changes what we understand in our past.  How we approach our future can also be  redirected.  Facing our mortality can  help us more clearly understand the distraction and harm resulting from  unnecessary battles and selfish ambition.  Some will just go on as they always have.  How many opportunities with the time to do  what is good will they miss?  Can we  really afford to fail those along our path who need our help and compassion?</p>
    <p>     You may be asking, what does all this mean  to me?  How does my mortality change the  context of blindness, Political or social improvement?  The truth is, facing this reality is basic to  all that we think and do.  The truth is,  We, are the secret keepers.  And what we  know, should not continue to be a secret to others.  We know that persons with out sight can enjoy  satisfying productive lives.  We know  that the blind can successfully earn a living in many occupations and  professions.  We also know that the  general view of blindness, is often misunderstood and far from the reality we  face.  We know that with training and  opportunity, we are the most expert at defining our own limits.</p>
    <p>     Every thing we do represents a decision.  Even not doing something, is a decision.  Our personal experience, and growth, feeds  the root of much that we decide and do.   It even changes how we define failure or success.  What decisions can we now act on, that are  different from decisions in our past?</p>
    <p>     As an organized minority of citizens  facing the challenges of blindness, We will continue to come into contact with  those who will need to know the secrets in our unique knowledge and experience.  We can share them as a duty, or a joy.  Professional or volunteer, we can help each  other according to a higher purpose.   Can we dedicate ourselves to a caring mission  with passion?  Can we recognize even the  simple things we do as part of a greater purpose?</p>
    <p>     We can choose to remain in the illusion of  our own comfort and pleasure, or wake up to the wonder of our life's vivid  realities.  There is a brief mission  statement for our organization at the beginning of each newsletter. But mission  statements are just words, if they are not acted on with purpose and  compassion.  When people come to us who  are losing sight, along with their family members and friends, what will truly motivate  us?  Will we be the caring guides they  need us to be, offering help and comfort?</p>
    <p>     There are those in our organization who  already have their mortality prospective.   They more than just respond.  They  seem to know how brief life's opportunities are.  Their gifts to us represent more than money,  time, skill, or energy.  Those around them  draw strength from their passion, understanding, and wisdom.  Those among us who have been blessed to learn  from our mortality reality, can truly unite as brothers and sisters.  Our daily acts of compassion toward one  another, will unite us as one family.  I feel  blessed to be a growing member of this family, and invite those of you who have  not yet joined, to schedule your own mental meeting with mortality.  After that experience, you also can share the  remaining moments of your life as a blessing of compassion and joy.</p>
    <p>                     2006 Convention Update<br />
      By Kyle Austin, Convention  Chairperson</p>
    <p>     As we look back at the 33rd annual  convention, I feel that we can call it a huge success.  This year Sixty eight people attended.  Thanks to all attendees and the great time had  by all.  We particularly want to extend  our gratitude to Mike Ellis (mee inc.) for putting together a great group of  exhibits for Friday afternoon and for his generous donation of products for a  fundraiser that raised over $500 for MCBVI.  <br />
      Our annual auction hit an all time high.  After a recount of money, we raised $1,126.00 from the auction.  Thanks to all who made contributions for the  auction and everyone who paid big bucks for several items.      The break out sessions were well attended  on Saturday. The banquet was enjoyed by all.   President Mike Geno made a very moving speech that had an effect on  everyone who attended.</p>
    <p>     The Sunday business meeting was well  attended.  I am sure you will be reading  more about the business meeting later in this publication.<br />
      Thanks to all who attended and also thanks  to all who helped put on the 33rd annual convention for MCBVI.  It just gets bigger and better every year!</p>
    <p>                        What Do I Do When<br />
      My College Doesn't<br />
      Accommodate My Disability?<br />
      By Donna Rose</p>
    <p>     Sometimes students come to us with horror  stories about the lack of reasonable accommodations that they should be able to  expect from their colleges or universities.   The best thing that a student can do is to check out the services at a  college or university prior to enrolling, and pick out one that is best prepared  to meet their needs.  <br />
      As someone who sued a major university in  Michigan for simple reader service, I would have the following  recommendations.  First, make certain to  put all requests into writing.  Be  specific as to what your needs are and why the accommodation is necessary.  If you are denied an accommodation you need  to document this with the date of the denial.   If you wish to appeal a denial do that in writing as well to the  director of services to students with disabilities on your campus and your  school's ombudsman.  Keep all communications  you receive, including e-mails.  What you  are doing is creating a paper trail.  In  my case I chose to withdraw from school and file a complaint with the US  Department of Education.  Their Office of  Civil Rights (OCR) is the government agency that takes and investigates  education discrimination.  There is a  strict time limit as to how long you have to file a complaint, but you should  exhaust all other remedies prior to doing this which will strengthen your case.   There are many helpful resources  available on their web site by going to www.ed.gov/ocr.  You can also reach them by phone at  800-421-3481, or by e-mail at OCR@ed.gov.   I will discuss the types of ways you can evaluate accommodations at a prospective  school in a future newsletter.</p>

    <p>                     Daily Bus Service Soon<br />
      By Donna Rose</p>
    <p>     Many of our members and friends will be  happy to learn that on November 16th a new company called Michigan Flyer will  offer seven round trips per day to and from Detroit Metro Airport originating in  Lansing.  The bus service is a  partnership of Skybird Okemos Travel and Owosso-based Indian Trails Inc.  The company is hoping to eventually add  service every hour during the day.  Buses  will run from the Marriott at University Place, 300 M.A.C. Ave., East Lansing,  to the Sunoco station at 3000 Dunckel Road, Lansing to Starbucks Corp.'s  coffeehouse at 1801 North West Ave., Jackson. Then the route will proceed to  the airport and back the same way.  The  trip is expected to take 1 hour and 40 minutes.   Ticket prices are $25 each way for individuals, $40 each way for doubles  and $60 each way for a family of up to six from the same household.  After contacting the company, I have been  asked by a representative there to help them make their web site more  accessible.  For more information you can  contact the company by phone at 517-349-0359, or on their web site at,  www.michiganflyer.com.  I am hoping that this  service can expand to other areas and have indicated this to the company.</p>
    <p>                         Diabetes Corner<br />
      By Donna Rose</p>
    <p>     A few items came across my desk that I  thought I should share with our diabetic audience.<br />
      The first is news about a new talking tiny  glucose meter that has been produced in Taiwan and is available here in the  States.   The Prodigy Meter measures 3-7/8 inches x  1-3/4 inches x 15/16 inch.  The meter  uses &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; capillary action, touchable test strips.  The meter costs $30.99, and a box of 50 strips  costs $18.95. Order five boxes of strips, and the meter is free. Medicare  beneficiaries who have met their deductible can get the meter and supplies for  free.  It has already been FDA-approved.  Contact the retailer, Diabetic Support  Program, at 1-800-990-9826, or via their Web site www.prescriptionsplus.com.</p>
    <p>     The second item is the Braille Pocket  Doctor, a 72 page book in contracted Braille for new diabetics which was  Written by an Endocrinologist, a Registered Dietitian, and a Certified Diabetes  Educator.  The book contains many helpful  sections including an explanation of diabetes, hints for eating and dining out,  blood glucose monitoring, web and phone resources and more.  The price of the 72 page Braille edition is  $47, which includes shipping.  This publication  is also available in regular size print for $6.95, including shipping.  Contact Pocket Reference Journals by phone at714-965-4570,  or visit their web site www.pocketreferencejournals.com.<br />
      On November 8, 2006     join the First International Virtual Audio  On-line Symposium on Diabetes.  Scheduled  to take place from 10 AM until 3 PM PST, the speakers will include Gretchen  Becker who wrote the Book &quot;Living with Type 2 Diabetes,&quot; Dr. Bernard  Mahaver who will discuss the various drugs in use to control Diabetes, and   Finally, Dr. Anne Williams, a noted Diabetic Educator  who will discuss Research and Trends in Diabetic care.

    <p>               Medicare Part D Plans Have  Changed<br />
      By Donna Rose</p>
    <p>     Once again it is time to choose a Medicare  Part D plan if you receive Medicare and you are not covered better by another  health plan.  Plan coverage has changed,  so don't assume that the plan you chose in 2006 will be the same price or cover  the same benefits and drugs.  There are  several places where you can go to get help making your decision about which  plan is right for you.  You can try  www.medicare.gov where there is a tool that allows you to choose the pharmacies  you would like to use, along with the ability to enter your medications.  The tool will calculate the cost of each plan  for your personal circumstances.  Then  you can make an informed choice.   Medicare beneficiaries can also get help from the Michigan Medicare Medicaid  Assistance Program by calling 800-803-7174 and leaving a message so they can  return your call.  You can enroll in a  new plan from November 15 to December 31 each year.   </p>
    <p>                MCBVI 2006 Convention  Resolutions</p>
    <p>     The following are resolutions which were  passed by a majority during the October Annual Business Meeting.</p>
    <p>                    MCBVI RESOLUTION 2006-01</p>
    <p>     Whereas, Much of the information  legislators and the public have been given regarding the services in which  news is distributed to blind and visually impaired persons--such as newspapers,  magazines, etc.-has been misleading; and<br />
      Whereas, HB5354 infers that the NFB  Newsline is the only way to access news and information; and<br />
      Whereas, Electronic services, such as  those rendered by the NFB Newsline, are very useful to many blind and visually  impaired people; and<br />
      Whereas, They are not the only means by  which such materials are, or should be dispersed; and<br />
      Whereas, Information provided by radio  reading services is accessed by special receivers, local cable TV public access  channels as well as through the Internet; and<br />
      Whereas, Radio reading services use  volunteers who read local newspapers, shopping ads and coupons, provide community  and human interest programming, and offer some listener participation in discussion  of issues related to blindness and visual impairment; and<br />
      Whereas, This human element is often  preferred by those who do not or cannot handle listening to synthesized speech  from computer-based reading services; and<br />
      Whereas, Senior citizens who have complex  medical conditions cannot navigate the complicated menu systems of the  telephone and computer-based technology used by the Newsline;<br />
      Now, therefore be it resolved by the  Michigan Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired in convention assembled at  the Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel in Wyoming, Michigan, on Sunday, October 8, 2006,  That if state or federal money is to be given for the purpose of making  information available to the entire blind and visually impaired population in  Michigan, then it is our belief that the radio reading services around the  state should be recipients of that money as well; and<br />
      Be it further resolved that, To place a  surcharge on telephone bills to enable this type of service only would be very  unfair; and<br />
      Be it further resolved that, We encourage  the maintenance of
      robust  radio reading services as well as the funding of other audio information services  which would include a more diverse special needs population.</p>
    <p>                    MCBVI Resolution 2006-02</p>
    <p>     Whereas, HB5354 states in Section 13 (1)  &quot;The Newsline for the blind fund is created within the state  treasury;&quot; and      Whereas, HB5354  also states in Section 13 (2), &quot;The state treasurer shall receive the  money designated under section 12 (1) (a) for deposit into the fund. The state  treasurer may receive money or other assets from any source for deposit into  the fund&quot;; and<br />
      Whereas, (4) of this law also states, &quot;The Michigan Commission for  the Blind shall expend money from the fund upon appropriation only for  distribution to the National Federation of the Blind of Michigan for the  purpose of the NFB-Newsline program;&quot; and<br />
      Whereas, This type of funding arrangement  introduces a conflict of interest involving the Michigan Commission For the Blind  (MCB) regularly handling the dispersal of government-administered funds to a  single political action group; and<br />
      Whereas, Financial support of one  politically active organization that seeks to assert its own agenda,  philosophy, and services that the fiduciary agency is supposed to equally  provide to all consumers disenfranchises all other stakeholders not in or supported  by that lone faction; and<br />
      Whereas, The supporters of HB5354--now  signed into law by Governor Granholm, failed to include any assurances,  standard protection, or even minimal fiscal safeguards or requirements of any  kind for the NFB to provide government and Michigan taxpayers even the most  basic and standard reports or information usually required in the operation of  programs and services financially supported with government-managed funds; and<br />
      Whereas, HB5354 authorizes the Michigan  Department Of the Treasury to capture funds from &quot;any source,&quot; paving  the way for last-minute &quot;pork barrel&quot; funneling of funds to a  politically biased organization that does not equally represent the interests of  all citizens or the blind; and<br />
      Whereas,   NFB has blurred its identity with political lobbying and influences on  state and national issues of government by intermixing service programs that  are solely owned and managed by their members; and<br />
      Whereas,   HB5354 infers that the  NFB  Newsline is the only way to access news and information; and<br />
      Whereas,   The NFB has not always been forthcoming in providing full disclosure as  to the costs, actual usage, and standard service delivery statistics or  measurements that are usually required of other partner contractors and used to  evaluate consumer impact and service delivery efficiency and outcome profiles;  and<br />
      Whereas,   MCB has already demonstrated the influence of this funding bias in their  internal political communications, contracts with NFB-managed programs, and  employment of and contracts with  individual  NFB-M members; and<br />
      Whereas, The letter sent by the MCB Board  Of Commissioners to Governor Granholm favoring this bill before its passage and  endorsed personally to her by the MCB Director in direct contrast with a  standing policy enforced by the Commission Director prohibiting internal  lobbying of any legislation by any MCB staff and partner associates including  representatives on their Consumer Involvement Council;<br />
      NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the  Michigan Council Of The Blind and Visually Impaired in convention assembled on  Sunday, October 8, 2006, at the Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel in Wyoming, Michigan,  that MCBVI opposes MCB functioning simply as a &quot;pass through&quot; for  money appropriated through this type of fund to one political group; and<br />
      Be it further resolved that, The MCBVI  will seek an explanation from all government rules, procedures,  and ethics-monitoring entities--calling upon  them to make a full investigation revealing how such problem legislation was  processed into law; and<br />
      Be it further resolved that, The MCBVI  will seek the support of other concerned organizations and interests to promote  the introduction of future legislation that nullifies the problems inherent in  the current language of HB5354 and that also introduces new procedures and  options that are free of conflicts of interest insuring fair and equitable  opportunities to all politically active organizations or information services  available to consumers wishing to impact policies implemented by the MCB; and<br />
      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Priority  Action Committee formed at the July 15, 2006, MCBVI board meeting will be responsible  for acting on the inquiries listed above and recommend what actions-if  any--should be taken; and<br />
      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that MCBVI--if not  successful in the other purposes of this resolution--may pursue remedies in the  courts to rescind, declare illegal,  or  achieve rulings more favorable for all Michigan citizens and stakeholders.</p>

      Fund Raising<br />
      By Jeanette Geno, Chairperson</p>
    <p>     At our annual business meeting I turned  over five checks from the Vehicle Donation Processing Center to our mcbvi  treasurer John McMahon. Thanks to our President, Michael Geno, for writing  letters on behalf of our organization so we could finally receive funds due to  us.  Donna Rose our First Vice President  also shared some very helpful information about fund raising projects chapters  might find very successful.  We are  looking into future contribution options with the Charity Motors operation out  of Detroit.  Stay tuned for more details,  and keep those fund raising ideas coming.</p>

    <p>     This is our final newsletter of 2006.  Anyone who paid their dues for this year will  receive the January newsletter as well. New members start receiving newsletters  in April and receive them through January of the next year.  President Geno asked me to place the contact  information for our executive board and committee chairs in the January  issue.  You will want to keep that  section of your next newsletter for future reference as it is only printed once  per year to save money.  Thanks to all of  you who send me items of interest in between newsletters.  I save these for possible publication  later.  B.J. Seaman will be putting our newsletter  into large print, Wayne Lepiors is duplicating the cassette edition.  And the Blue Water League still does the Braille.  I will likely be submitting the large print  file from B.J. to the e-mail recipients.

    <p>                           Resolutions<br />
      By Chris Schumacher,  Chairperson</p>
    <p>     Our committee's hard work over the last  few months resulted in four resolutions that were presented and passed at the  MCBVI convention in October.  I would  like to thank Casey Dutmer, Sue Illingworth, Neal Freeling and Deb Wild for all  their hard work and support.  Special  thanks also go to Mike Geno and Donna Rose for their valuable input in the  discussion and writing of these resolutions.   As we move forward and await the results of these, however, we must  begin to think about other issues that we would start to work on next  year.  So, as our initial committee  meetings are basically discussions of current concerns that might serve as the  basis for resolutions, it is not too early to hear from you to help get this  process going.  Feel free to contact me  or any other 
      member  of the committee with your ideas.  Happy  holidays!       </p>

      By Donna Rose</p>
    <p>     In June our chapter had a nice luncheon in  the dining room at the residence of Jim and Arlene Moore.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our time  together.  In July a few of us met  informally for lunch.  We have had to  relocate our meetings to a new place as the Korner Kitchen has converted their  banquet room into a bakery/deli.  We have  had a little difficulty getting going this fall, but we hope to have elections  during our November meeting.  Several of  us want to do some extra activities, like attending a MoPix movie at our local  Celebration Cinema.  MoPix is relatively  new to our area.  We will have a party in  early December when we will sing holiday carols and celebrate the upcoming  holidays.  Our new meeting place is the  Gone Wired Caf‚ in Lansing.  For further  details and to make a reservation please call President Jim Moore at  517-374-8681.  We wish all of you a  prosperous holiday season.</p>

    <p>                    Detroit Northwest Council <br />
      By Chris Schumacher</p>
    <p>     Our chapter met during the summer  months.  The July meeting was a picnic in  my backyard.  The highlight of the party  was having our members sing with a karaoke machine provided by our guests, Diane  and Larry Luty.  As the old Osmond song  says, our chapter is a &quot;little bit country and a little bit rock n'  roll.&quot;  I sang the country, and  Carlton George and Tyrone Hamilton provided the rock n' roll with some Motown  soul. Our August and September meetings focused on organizing our next  fundraiser and transportation to the convention.  We did not meet in October.  In November we will be paying our dues and  organizing our holiday get-together.  We  meet at Brownie's Diner in Wayne.  Call  George Illingworth at 313:937-9687 for more information and to make a  reservation.  We hope you all have a  blessed holiday season!</p>
    <p>                        Kalamazoo Council<br />
      By Sherry Gordon </p>
    <p>     On Saturday, July 22, fourteen members of  the KCBVI met at the home of Lisa Kisiel for food and fun.  Lisa and Charlotte Robinson provided  hamburgers, hot dogs and brats, which were done on the grill.  Everything tastes great on the grill!  Everyone brought a dish to pass and  everything was yummy!  Following dinner,  we had a discussion about a number of important issues, related to persons with  visual impairments.  We also discussed  the possibility that the KCBVI host the 2007 conference of the Michigan Council  of the Blind and Visually Impaired.  We  decided this would be a great idea.  We  plan to put in a &quot;bid&quot; to host the 2007 conference at the business  meeting of the MCBVI at this year's fall convention in October.  KCBVI had six members who attended the fall  MCBVI conference in Wyoming.  We had a nice  time and enjoyed the auction!!  We are  continuing with plans to have the 2007 MCBVI conference in Kalamazoo and will  have a definite proposal for the MCBVI Executive Committee within the next  couple of months.<br />
      At our October 12 meeting, we had two  different speakers.  One speaker, from  the Kalamazoo county clerk's office, spoke to us about the AutoMARK voting  machine.  This was really cool and we all  got the opportunity to try the machine.   We hope everyone votes on November 7!   This machine is great since it allows persons with disabilities to use  the same paper ballot as persons who use the regular voting machines!  We also had a couple of speakers on the county-wide  millage proposal.  We certainly hope the  millage passes so our transportation system in Kalamazoo and surrounding areas  can be maintained for all riders.<br />
      On October 14, a group of seven KCBVI  members went to VerHague's orchard.  This  is our annual orchard trip.  Many good apples,  donuts, caramel apples and cider were enjoyed by all.      Our annual membership meeting is coming up  on Thursday, November 9.  We hope to have  several new members this year! For further information about the Kalamazoo  Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired, contact Secretary Lisa Kisiel at  (269) 552-4082.</p>

      By Deb Wild</p>
    <p>     VIPP had our first meeting after our  summer break on Tuesday, 09-12-06. We met at the Grandvilla Restaurant in  Grandville and were pleased to have Braille menus. We had one new guest who expressed  an interest in joining. About fourteen people participated in a relaxing Friday  evening dinner cruise on the Grand Lady down the Grand River. On 09/21 our  MoPix group containing VIPP members and many deaf and hearing impaired members,  joined guests, dignitaries and media at Studio 28 for a long overdue party  celebrating our one-year anniversary. Michigan now has seven MoPix theaters set  up, where a little over a year ago there were none. Folks will get to try out  the equipment by watching the movie &quot;The Black Dahlia.&quot; Casey Dutmer  was elected by acclamation as secretary. Charis and her committee have been working  on revising the Bylaws which will be e-mailed soon. Joe Sibley created some new  VIPP brochures. Many other items were discussed.  If you would like further information about  VIPP, please contact our membership chair, Jan Luurtsema, at (616) 531-8072.</p>
    <p>                    Summary of Board Meeting<br />
      July 15, 2006</p>
    <p>     There was approval of a $500.00 grant for  a CCTV. Three scholarship applications are in process as well. Concerning  vehicle donations, Mike briefly reviewed reports from the last three months. In  April the Vehicle Donations Center took in about $1,200.00. MCBVI received  nothing after expenses were deducted. May was very similar, with MCBVI again  receiving nothing. In June they took in nearly $2,000.00, deducting over $600  for ads to the Grand Rapids Press, along with other expenses. MCBVI again  received no portion of the funds VDPC collected. MCBVI had not agreed to increase  any advertizing payments    to the Grand  Rapids Press. After a phone discussion last June, the Vehicle Processing Center  agreed to review the reports from January 2006 on. After this review MCBVI  received only a reimbursement check for approximately $200.00 for these  unauthorized Google charges. ACB also uses this vehicle donations program,  meaning MCBVI may have been competing with ACB for donations in Michigan.<br />
      George and Sue and Casey attended the ACB  convention in Jacksonville. George donated $25 for a door prize from MCBVI.  MCBVI will reimburse George.<br />
      Mike and Jeanette continue to work through  their health issues. Mike stated his surgery last March did not remove all his cancer.  They have been involved with much activity regarding health treatments,  Specialists and Trips to Detroit hospitals. <br />
      HB 53-54 was discussed. This involves the  proceeds from the sale of the former school for the blind property, this amount  being approximately $900,000.00. Sections 12 and 13 of this legislation  are of great concern. Pat Cannon fielded  questions from our Board.<br />
      He  stated the language of the bill changed after entering the Senate.  When asked about these concerns, he stated he  was not comfortable with this language. This bill, now passed in to law now known  as PA180 sets up a fund specifically for NFB Newsline. The Michigan Commission  For the Blind, a program charged with providing equal service and support to  all eligible visually impaired citizens, administers this fund that supports  only the NFB. According to Director Cannon, the original language had advocated  for some of this money to go into a trust fund for children who are blind or  have visual impairments, and for some of it to go to Camp Tusmheta. There is no  language included in this bill for accountability of any kind including the  NFB, yet it will draw from Michigan tax payers. This legislation presents a  serious conflict of interest. It was decided to form the Priority Action  Committee to investigate the process used to establish this law, and related ethics  issues. Legal council will be obtained to determine the legality of this slush  fund.<br />
      The finance committee is exploring  proposals to invest some of MCBVI's money. The financial holdings of the  Petersen scholarship Fund were discussed briefly. <br />
      The Technology Committee continues its  work on the web site. Technology training for a weekend in the winter or spring  of 2007 is being explored.  The Lewis  Braille coin legislation passed. All proceeds will go to the NFB for Braille  literacy. Electronics communications legislation was also discussed, including  audible services such as talking book radio.   NFB has taken steps to ask that a surcharge be added to phone bills for  operating their NFB Newsline service.<br />
      It was decided we investigate other  alternatives to the Vehicle Donations Processing Center, as well as to request  that they agree to a better percentage of received donation value each month.  President Geno Will also continue to insist we are to be paid all monies due to  us up to this time.  We authorized Mike  as president to contact all individuals involved to relay our concerns. If we  do not have these concerns dealt with in a satisfactory manner, we then will  terminate relations, with written notice, within thirty to sixty days, at the  discretion of the president. The Finance Committee was asked by Mike to look  into other alternatives such as Charity Motors in Detroit. A bid needs to be  made for the 2007 MCBVI convention.  Submitted by Deb Wild, Secretary</p>

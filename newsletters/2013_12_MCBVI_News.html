<h3 style="text-align:center">From the President</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">By Joe Sibley</p>
<p>Hello MCBVI Family!</p>


<p>
    So here we are getting ready to close out 2013. As we are also well into my last year as your president, it is time to reflect a bit on 2013, and the last
    5 years I have been honored to serve in this office. Per our bylaws my third term as president will end at our convention in 2014, so at the end of that
    convention I will turn the proverbial gavel over to someone else. This has been a wonderful opportunity for my personal growth and I am grateful for that.
    I hope I did some good along the way. There were things I handled well, and times where I dropped the ball. I feel we have some great momentum going in a
    number of areas, and other issues where we need to step up our game as an organization. Our executive board has set some goals for my last year as
    president which include such things as seeding at least one new chapter, getting our student chapter off the ground, upgrading our website and marketing
    materials and more. Whoever steps up as our next president will find themselves with a great leadership team, and a wonderful group in our membership. How
    can you help? What would you like to see MCBVI accomplish in the future? This is your organization, not mine or anyone else's. You are MCBVI and it's up to
    all of us to work together for the benefit of all of the blind and visually impaired in Michigan.
</p>
<p>
    Another great convention is behind us. We tried some new things this year, including the multiple breakouts Saturday afternoon. I admit I was a little
    concerned as it was a little confusing, but everyone did just find and found where they wanted to be for each session. Our broadcast team did a great job
    handling everything too, and for the first time we broadcast our Sunday business meeting on our own MCBVI Radio stream which we will be using more in the
    future. Gerry Grossman, the Human Jukebox from Chicago had everyone rolling on the floor at our banquet. We had a successful fund raiser Thursday night at
    Connexions Comedy Club. It was all great and I thank Casey and all of our convention committee members and the many hands who worked together so well as
    they always do. A lot of work goes into putting together a convention, it is exhausting, but it is one of my favorite activities of the whole year.
</p>
<p>
    Next year our convention will be in Kalamazoo at the Four Points by Sheraton, the former Clarion. We are booked there for two years. The convention
    committee is already working on it. Watch for some changes as we try to make convention better and better every year. As I announced before the newly
    elected president of the American Council of the Blind Kim Charlson will be joining us and I am very excited to welcome her.
</p>
<p>
    I usually don't give out book suggestions, but I have recently read "People of Vision, A History of the American Council of the Blind" and it is
    fascinating. If you really want to know where ACB came from and why we belong to this organization this is a must read. It is very detailed in what led up
    to the "civil war" in the NFB that resulted in the creation of the ACB. It is very detailed on the whole development of the organized blind movement and
    how ACB grew into the amazing body that it is. This book is available from the library for the blind, or you can download it from BARD.
</p>
<p>
    Well, Donna is waiting for this so I will close for this issue, but please accept from Mary and I our wishes for a wonderful holiday season, and great
    blessings in the New Year! Joe
</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">It's MCBVI Dues Time Again</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">By Charis Austin, MCBVI Treasurer</p>


<p>
    It is time to start collecting 2014 membership dues for both the Michigan Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired (MCBVI) and the American Council of
    the Blind (ACB). Anyone who is a member of MCBVI is also a member of ACB. Some people have indicated that they are more concerned about what happens in
    Michigan, however, you are getting benefits from being a member of ACB. ACB was involved in getting legislation passed relating to accessible
    prescriptions, quiet cars, and accessible cell phones.
</p>
<p>
    All membership information and dues must be received by February 15, 2014. Reminder: in 2012 we passed an amendment to the Bylaws which states that any
    dues received for renewing members after February 15 will be returned. This amendment was passed to insure the timely submission of membership information
    and dues by both Chapters and Members at Large. THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS TO LATE PAYMENTS!
</p>
<p>
    Please include $10 for each person who wishes to be a member; $5 is sent to ACB to cover that portion of the dues. Local chapters may charge additional
    dues for their chapter memberships.
</p>
<p>
    Include the following information on your membership list:
</p>
<p>
    Name, Address, City, State and Zip; Phone numbers (home and/or cell and specify which you are giving(: Email Address: Vision Status: Sighted, Visually
    Impaired, Legally Blind, or Totally Blind which is for mailing purposes to comply with "Free Matter" postal regulations.
</p>
<p>
    The last information we need is format choice for receiving publications from MCBVI and ACB. The MCBVI NEWS is published in email, Braille, Large Print,
    and Audio CD. The ACB BRAILLE FORUM is published in Braille, Large Print, and cassette, Audio CD, Email or Podcast. If you want one of the last two choices
    you must sign up for it yourself.
</p>
<p>
    Send membership renewal and payment to:
</p>
<p>
    Charis Austin, Treasurer
</p>
<p>
    2426 Thornwood Street, SW
</p>
<p>
    Wyoming, MI 49519
</p>
<p>
    Checks should be made out to MCBVI with a note in the memo line stating 2014 Membership. New this year: We are now able to accept credit cards through
    PayPal: MasterCard, Visa, American Express or Discover. If you wish to pay by credit card, please contact me by phone at (616) 532-4737. Since this is my
    residence, no calls after 9:00pm please.
</p>

<div id="MessageFromSara" style="text-align:left">

<h3 style="text-align:center">Message to all in MCBVI and its chapters</h3>
<p>By Sarah Conrad</p>
<p>
    First of all, I want to thank you once again for having me speak at our
    recent MCBVI convention. I had a wonderful time meeting many of you and
    presenting about current issues in the American Council of the Blind. In
    addition, I want to follow up with you about some of the things we discussed
    during my presentation. As you may recall, I asked discussion questions at
    the end. We were unable to hear responses from every group and individual in
    the room, due to time constraints. I would, however, like to continue these
    conversations. As a reminder, here were the questions we discussed:

<ul>
   <li>1. How do we as an organization and as individuals locate students or young people who might get involved in MCBVI?<li>
   <li>2. Once we have students in our organization, how do we keep them? In other words, how do we work on membership retention for young people?</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In addition to these questions, I encourage you to think about ways I can assist our great affiliate as a member the ACB national board of directors.
</p>
<p>
    Please feel free to email me to continue dialogue about these issues. I can
    be reached at <a href="mailto:president.acbstudents@gmail.com">president.acbstudents@gmail.com</a>.

<p>Thank you, Sara Conrad</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Making it Through the Holidays</h3>
<p style="text-align:center">By Donna Rose</p>
<p>
    The holidays can be a difficult time for people. Some have lost and/or have sick loved ones, have conflicts with their families, or are simply lonely or
    feel alone. Then there can be the financial burden of the season. While it is true we can change our minds and decide to be happy. Here are some tricks
    which can help make the holidays more bearable.
</p>
<p>
    Don't dwell on the negative. Stay in the moment. It can be helpful to distract yourself by doing something active you like to do. I like to go shopping and
    just browse while getting some exercise. Sometimes I make jewelry, call a friend or meet someone for lunch.
</p>
<p>
    If you must spend time with your extended family members who may try and drive you nuts, limit your time with them, and by all means don't start talking
    about anything controversial. Just remember the moments you may have to spend with them can be limited and won't last forever. If you choose not to spend
    the holidays with your family, but don't want to be alone, there are probably others in your circle who feel the same way and would love to get together.
    Have a potluck and plan a grab bag gift exchange to make the party more festive. Remember our family doesn't have to be just our blood relation.
</p>
<p>
    If you are able to give some time to a helping organization wrapping presents, filling food baskets or working a soup kitchen on Christmas or New Years, I
    can bet you will begin to feel like you are a part of something bigger which could make the holidays brighter for others as well as yourself.
</p>
<p>
    Purchasing gifts for everyone on your list can be difficult, especially if your income is fixed. Plan way ahead and you might be able to find inexpensive
    gifts which are unique. If possible attend craft or even antique shows where small, but useful gifts are often available. I often bake gifts for people. If
    I want to buy more expensive gifts I try to pick them up right after the holidays when they are cheaper, or begin to purchase gifts in August so I am not
    spending all of my money in December on presents. Some online catalogs sell decorative personalized bags and other storage items which don't cost much and
    for free will print your name or family name on them. For example, a set of bags for holiday cookies could say, "From the Rose Kitchen".
</p>
<p>
    AS I get older I would like it if we celebrated Christmas every other year or even every five years so it would be more special and less materialistic. But
    it is what it is. For the most part I believe the one thing that can bring a sense of joy is gratitude. There is absolutely no joy without it. So I would
    say sit down and count your blessings. Take accounting of what you do have in your life when you first begin to feel down, overstressed, or cranky. It
    doesn't have to be a long list. Sometimes I think about my wonderful home (how nice it is to live indoors), and the convenience of having my own washer and
    dryer. I think about how lucky I am to have such incredibly great friends. Sometimes I have been known to think about the types of food in my kitchen or
    even my clean sheets on the bed. And when you remind yourself of your blessings it is hard to remain sad. Don't be too hard on yourself as you try to
    fulfill others expectations. Be true to yourself. Love yourself and it will be easier to love others.

<p>
    Need a new computer for home, school, or work? Can't afford the latest top-of-the-line dell or hp? Need something powerful that will last you a number of
    years while being reliable and getting the job done? The refurbished laptops I am offering will solve nearly all your problems.
</p>
<p>
    If you need a laptop that is fast, reliable and guaranteed not to get windows viruses?
</p>
<p>
    If you are tired of trying to find the right spyware and antivirus for you, or are worried that your web surfing habits could cause your computer to
    eventually run slowly, then my custom refurbished laptops may be what you're looking for.
</p>
<p>
    These laptops are 64bit. By default they come pre-installed with windows7. This makes them slower than they could be and also a bit less reliable and of
    course prone to viruses and spyware. When you receive the laptop you'll be getting a laptop set up with Vinux talking out of the box with your choice of
    e-speak, eloquence, or cepstral voices of your choosing. I can even customize the keyboard hotkeys to your liking. If you like a jaws layout or window-eyes
    layout I can customize that before shipping.
</p>
<p>
    What is Vinux? Vinux is a fast, stable, and reliable open source operating system with a friendly user interface that comes with all of the apps you will
    need to be productive at home, work, or play. With apps such as libre-office an alternative and easy to use office suite, gnu-cash, powerful accessible
    financial management software that works with quickbooks files the powerful jaws-for-windows-like scriptable Orca screen reader, firefox for web browsing,
    adobe flash for youtube, Mozilla Thunderbird with the lightning calendar, and more. On average they have 2gigs of ram and an 80gig hard drive. These
    laptops will sell for $245. I prefer Paypal for payment but will accept check or money order.

<h4>Convention</h4>
<p>By Casey Duttmer, Chairperson</p>

    The financial details of our annual state convention are as follows:
</p>
<p>
    We had about 60 registered this year. We started out with $2260.22. We spent $1,000 for the 2014 and 2015 conventions. That gave us a balance of $1260.22.
</p>
<p>
    We deposited $5879.15. This gave us a balance of $7139.37.
</p>
<p>
    Our expenses were $6021.31 leaving a balance of $1118.06.
</p>
<p>
    We paid the hotel $4,094.02. Jerry Grooseman was paid $650. The bus fees were $198.74. We grossed $920 on the fund-raiser. We earned from the comedy show
    $280 and the bus $198.74
</p>
<p>
    We made $441.02 on the fund raiser.
</p>
<p>
    We made over $1409 on the auction. Next year the convention will be held in Kalamazoo.
</p>

</div>

<div id="Membership" style="text-align:left">
<h4>Membership</h4>
<p>Charis Austin, Chairperson</p>
<p>
    As of this date, we have 163 members. This is a little lower than last year possibly due to the organization passing an amendment not allowing members to
    renew membership after the February 15 deadline. Please see my article earlier in this issue regarding the submission of dues for the upcoming year.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Nominations" style="text-align:left">
<h4>Nominations</h4>
<p>By Karla Fields, Chairperson</p>
<p>
    Back in September at the 2013 State convention in Lansing the following people were elected to their offices by acclamation: First Vice President John
    Jarzyna; Second Vice President Sharmese Anderson; Treasurer Charis Austin; and assistant secretary Mary Sibley.
</p>
<p>
    AT our convention in 2014 we will need to elect a new president (Joe Sibley's three terms are over), so please think about running yourself or for someone
    else you can nominate. Also in 2014 the offices for secretary and assistant treasurer will be up for re-election. If you would like to become a candidate
    or nominate someone please call me at (586)465-2338.

<h4>Blue Water League for the Blind (Port Huron Area)</h4>
<p>By Phyllis Magbanua</p>
<p>
    Hello to all our friends in MCBVI. This has been a very busy and exciting year for the Blue Water League. From going out for lunch and dinner and having
    three very special guess Mary and Joe Sibley and John Jarzyna along with their drivers. We also went to Lansing to The Library without Walls. We also did
    two trail walks this year. One in the spring and the other was in September. Both times we went we took a lunch with us and had a very good time. In July
    we had a picnic at one of our parks. We also went on the Huron Lady 2 boat on the St. Clair River. Then we went to Pine Grove Park and had our ice cream
    social. IN September we had a picnic given by the Port Huron Lions as host. We also had seven of our members attend state convention this year. Thanks to
    the generosity of the United Way for helping us with transportation costs and providing a vehicle for the Lansing trips. They also helped pay for us to go
    to winter camp. In addition the BWL held a pancake fund-raiser in June. It turned out well thanks to the knights of Columbus of Lakeport.
</p>
<p>
    In November we are having our Thanks Giving Dinner meeting at the Dorsey Steak House on Thursday night November 21st at 6pm. Then on December 5th The Port
    Huron Lions Host our Christmas party like they do every year. At this time we the members of BWL would like to thank all the people that have helped us out
    this past year. Very special thanks go to our sighted members and the United Way for their assistance to those who needed it.
</p>
<p>
    The members of the blue water league would like to wish everyone a very Happy Holiday and a Happy New Year! We hope this coming year will be full of

<h4>Cadillac Council of the blind</h4>
<p>By Carl and Cathy Daily</p>
<p>
    On October 11, 2013 the Cadillac Council of the Blind in cooperation with Family Fare Super markets, the Cadillac Lions Club and the Wexford County Transit
    Authority devoted their time to the Stuff the bus project. This event took place at Family Fare and the goal was to fill the bus with food for three local
    food pantries. The event was a huge success and everyone was amazed by the generosity of those who gave food items!
</p>
<p>
    Here is an excerpt from the Cadillac News, "Stuffed", by Mardi Suhs. "Military veteran donated a cart of groceries, including cases of vegetables. As he
    rolled up to the bus with his donation he said, "This is America and nobody should go hungry in the United States." An elderly lady asked for a list of
    what the food pantries needed. Then she went shopping. "I may not have much," she said when she returned. "But I have plenty to share."
</p>
<p>
    "Things like that, they just melted my heart," Cathy said. "I truly felt the blessings from heaven opening up and blessing us. We were richly blessed."
</p>
<p>
    It was great to have support for the cause and well worth braving the cold!
</p>
<p>
    Cadillac Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired members wish everyone a happy and safe holiday season!

<div id="SummaryOfTheSummerBoardMeeting" style="text-align:left">
<h3 style="text-align:center">Summary of the 07/20/13 MCBVI Summer Board Meeting</h3>
<p style="text-align:center">Submitted by Secretary Debbie Robinson</p>
<p>
    Due to several complications, the 07/20/13 MCBVI summer board meeting was conducted by teleconference. It began at 10:07 a.m. and ended at 1:25 p.m. All
    chapter delegates and officers were present, and we had 22 participants. The agenda was approved as read. The minutes from the spring board meeting were
    approved as emailed.
</p>
<p>
    President Sibley discussed the recently concluded ACB national convention in Columbus, Ohio. Kim Charlson was elected as ACB's First woman president. She
    accepted his invitation to our 2014 convention in Kalamazoo. Michigan hosted the Midwest Caucus and had representation at the nominations caucus. They
    talked a lot about the WIPO treaty. There were about 18-20 resolutions and bylaw proposals. The Accessible Prescription Drug resolution standards were
    approved.
</p>
<p>
    He discussed the upcoming MCBVI convention and the new MCBVI brochure which he and Donna are working on. There is nothing new regarding the Ann Bratsberg
    issue. WE had paid her $500.00 awhile back and received three videos from her.
</p>
<p>
    The Michigan Commission for Blind Persons (MCBP) met on Thursday, 07/18/13. They broke up into several subcommittees including for the Training Center and
    the Business Enterprise Program (BEP). People are asking hard questions in a polite/productive manner. They have met with BEP management and hope to meet
    with some of the operators. The Commission meeting was streamed, and there were some issues.
</p>
<p>
    Joe discussed having open meetings for members to call and discuss concerns. The date for the first meeting was set for Saturday, 09/07/13 at 10:00 a.m.,
    using this number and participation code.
</p>
<p>
    Charis gave the financial report, prepared by Matt Livingston, with all figures from 06/30/13. The total checking account balance was $1,503.63. The total
    investment portfolio is $43,784.60. Total income from 01/01/13 to 06/30/13 is $2,607.41. Total expenses from the same time period were s $3,464.82.
    Resulting net loss was $857.41.
</p>
<p>
    Casey and Sharon are doing convention registration. The hotel sales manager Melissa resigned abruptly. There are some contract concerns which will be
    addressed. The Connect Comedy fundraiser with pizza buffet was discussed. Scott Norris from the Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped will be
    there. We are getting $150 from the Lansing Convention and Visitors' Bureau and $200 from Celebration Cinema for sponsors. Problems with reserving hotel
    rooms were discussed. There is a new accountant with the hotel who said everything was a mess.
</p>
<p>
    We need an interim grants committee chair. There have been a couple grant inquiries. There is no scholarship activity.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding legislation, the access board has been working with the committee to develop best practices regarding providing accessible prescription labels.
    As mentioned earlier, the Accessible Prescription Drug resolution standards were approved, so members need to contact and inform their pharmacies and
    request their prescriptions in an accessible format. The Anne Sullivan-Macey Act may become a bill. There was a national call-in day last June in which
    Michigan actively participated regarding this act. The Rehab Act has not moved yet. Many things are up in the air such as state pension issues, Medicaid
    issues and health care exchanges. Some of the Obama Health care has been delayed. They are trying to reinstate the home property tax.
</p>
<p>
    We have approximately 154 members. Several folks did not renew memberships last year because of the new deadline. Charis used the online membership method
    from ACB to submit information from MCBVI. There are some issues, but they are working on these. MCBVI's information was in on time.
</p>
<p>
    Donna discussed how the upcoming MCBVI convention was being publicize. She sent Joe a partial draft of the new MCBVI brochure. Malaina has been very
    helpful with the newsletter. The new MCBVI mission statement will be at the end of the newsletter eventually, with the first few pages containing contact
    information. Three newsletters went out this year, the last one containing convention information. The last newsletter released a CD edition instead of
    cassettes, and this was successful.
</p>
<p>
    There was no activity regarding Constitution and Bylaws.
</p>
<p>
    The Resolutions committee has met twice. Creating a student chapter was discussed. Working on potential BEP resolutions was discussed, as were concerns
    regarding sheltered workshops. We may vote on the resolutions pertaining to the hotel, the staff and the volunteers before the Sunday morning business
    meeting. There was nothing in the constitution to prohibit this.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding nominations, all the incumbent candidates are running: Jon Jarzyna for first vice president, Sharmese Anderson for 2nd vice president, Mary
    Sibley for assistant secretary and Charis Austin for treasurer. This is Joe's last term as president. We need to find another candidate for next fall.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding Technology, the MCBVI convention and the banquet will be streamed on ACB radio on the live events channel. Four of the breakout sessions on
    Saturday afternoon will be streamed. It was decided to stream the MCBVI Sunday morning business meeting on our web site. , Setting up a technology page on
    the MCBVI web site was discussed.
</p>
<p>
    The fund development committee has been working on getting convention sponsors. It was suggested if we all joined ACB's Monthly Monetary Support (MMS)
    program, it would be an easy way to get money for MCBVI.
</p>
<p>
    Casey reported that it was a good year for Camp Tusmheta and Opportunities Unlimited for the Blind (OUB). MCBVI and VIPP cosponsored a music camp and
    helped sponsor an OUB newsletter. A birding by ear event was covered by CBS. JoAnn Pilarski worked very hard for camp in the box events, including getting
    donations. Unfortunately the assistant director was let go.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding the new brochure, using an online printer is being explored. A thought was budgeting $600.00, and if more is needed, that can be brought to the
    board. A committee, which will meet by teleconference, was established to revise MCBVI's mission statement.
</p>
<p>
    After much discussion, it was decided to proceed with setting up a PayPal process for accepting donations and other revenues on our web site for convention
    and that we have this in place by 08/15/13. Charis will be monitoring everything.
</p>
<p>
    The Cadillac chapter working with the Department of Transportation (DOT) has three audible pedestrian signals installed. We were encouraged to check out
    the Blue Water League's web site. The Capitol Area totally rewrote their constitution and bylaws. They applied for Employee Identification numbers. But
    each chapter has to get their own solicitor's license. The Kalamazoo Council has five new members and was active publicizing at a downtown festival. VIPP
    and the campers from Camp Tusmheta enjoyed an audio-described Fourth of July parade. There was a Whitecaps baseball game outing in June, and there will be
    a picnic in August.
</p>
<p>
    Jeanette Geno is receiving Palliative care. She fell and has a compression fracture. They continue to try natural methods. There will be no more
    chemotherapy. She thanks everyone for their thoughts and prayers.

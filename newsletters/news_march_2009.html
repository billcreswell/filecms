    <p>E-mail address: <a href="mailto:Joe.sibley1@sbcglobal.net">Joe.sibley1@sbcglobal.net</a></p>
    <p align="justify">     Well I'm not sure if it's old age or what  but time sure seems to be moving quickly these days. We are well into 2009, a  good time to reflect on the events and most important the blessings of the past  year. Much has changed in my life in the past 12 months, and a big wonderful  change is coming to me in 2009 which you will know about soon. I am very  blessed including the many wonderful people I have come to know in MCBVI. It is  also a good time to take a good look at this organization and examine what we  are doing well, and where do we need some improvement. Our membership has grown  in recent years, but how do we spread the word to the hundreds of blind or  visually impaired people in this state that are not members about the benefits  of MCBVI membership. Why are some chapters growing while others are struggling?  How can we make MCBVI more attractive to potential young members?  We discussed that last issue at our January  board meeting.<br />
      Gwen Botting, president of Michigan  Parents of Visually Impaired (MPVI) joined us to discuss MPVI and also a new comprehensive  design team (CDT) that she is heading up to address the serious issues in the  state's educational system and the frequent poor handling of students who are  blind or visually impaired. I consider it a vital part of our organization's  outreach to participate in this process. Too many of our youth are being cheated  out of preparation to lead a full and productive life. If this is also a  passion of yours, please contact me and I will put you in touch with Gwen. The  future of MCBVI depends on our bringing new younger members to the table to  continue our work.<br />
      I truly appreciate the wonderful people  serving on our board of directors and chairing the vital committees to keep  things moving along. One need that we need to address is to find someone willing  to chair our fund raising efforts. An ideal candidate would be one who has  experience in, or is willing to learn about writing grants and seeking other  funding sources. Thinking outside the box could be very helpful. We also need  individuals interested in becoming historians for our organization, keeping  records of our newsletters and other activities.  We are looking for interested writers to  update our MCBVI handbook as well.   Please contact me if you are interested or know someone who might be.<br />
      As of this writing, the new and improved  MCBVI website is under construction thanks to the efforts of Michael Geno. This  will be a wonderful source of information and entertainment for those both  inside and outside the organization. Watch for an upcoming announcement about  our new URL in an upcoming issue of the newsletter. I am extremely excited  about this improved version of our organization's website.<br />
      Please feel free to contact me with any  thoughts or suggestions you have regarding this organization. Having only held this  office for a few months now, I welcome input from members. It is still my goal  to visit every chapter this year.<br />
      Finally, a major salute to Donna Rose who  does a wonderful job in putting this newsletter together. I'm not just  buttering her up because I am late getting this column to her, Donna does a  great job in finding and creating content and putting it together in a way that  allows MCBVI to shine. I am proud of our newsletter, great job Donna!<br />
      Have a wonderful spring and be thankful  for everything you have, and everyone you know!<br />

    <h3 align="center">Remembering Carlton 
      By Chris Schumacher</h3>
    <p align="justify">     His ministry.  That is how Carlton George, who went home to  be with the Lord on January 15th, 2009, saw providing transportation and  assistance to the members of the Detroit Northwest Chapter and MCBVI as well as  to other blind and visually impaired people in the Detroit area.  Many of us first met Carlton through Bonnie  Weaver, a former member of our chapter, as he was a volunteer driver for the  agency where she worked and eventually began bringing her and her daughter to  chapter meetings. As relationships evolved, he began offering his services to  other members of our chapter.  I remember  how frustrated he would get when staff in doctors' offices or waitresses in  restaurants would speak to him rather than ask the blind person with him.  He would say, &quot;Don't ask me.  I'm just the driver.&quot;  Initially, I think he did feel he was  &quot;just the driver&quot; because there were many times instead of staying in  meetings he would sit in his car and wait for us or run other errands.  However, we encouraged him to stay with us,  and he truly became a vital part of our organization.  At our last meeting in November we were  having a discussion about our chapter's future, projects we would like to do,  things we had done in the past, etc.   Carlton was passionate about the fact that no matter how many actual  projects we did or how much money we raised, the main thing we could be proud  of was how we support each other and the sense of family that we have in our  group.<br />
      When driving some members of our chapter  to an MCBVI board meeting, Carlton usually picked me up first.  I got in the back of his car, knowing that he  was going to get George and Sue and George would sit in the front.  Carlton said, &quot;Now we'll be like driving  Miss Daisy!&quot;  That was Carlton, a  great guy with a great sense of humor.   However, My fondest memory of him is when some of us went to the Visions  2006 event in Ann Arbor.  We were at the  Envision America table looking at the ID Mate Omni bar code reader.  Carlton could see that I was interested in  this but was hesitant about its hefty price tag.  He literally took over the sales  representative's job of explaining it to me as he was familiar with it.  Apparently, one of the other ladies that he  drove for had one and found that it helped her a great deal, and he wanted that  for me.  That was Carlton, enabling and  empowering.  I will always think of him  when I use it now.<br />
      So no, Carlton.  You were not &quot;just the  driver.&quot;  You were a dear friend and  a member of our Detroit Northwest Chapter and MCBVI family.  Yes, you will be greatly missed, but as the  Vince Gill song says, &quot;Go rest high on that mountain.  Son, your work on earth is done.&quot;</p>
    <h3 align="center">When Possible Use Local Phone  Numbers<br />
      By Donna Rose, Editor</h3>
    <p align="justify">     The MCBVI Board of Directors asks you not  to use our toll free numbers unless you do not have flat rate long distance  service.  Last year our phone bill for  our toll free usage was over $800.  We pay  for calls to these numbers and not to have the numbers themselves.  Instead we ask you to use the local number  listed for the person you want to contact.   We want you to be able to get a hold of us, so if you don't have flat  rate long distance service on your land line or cell phone, you may use the  toll free at your own discretion.  Please  understand the toll free numbers are set aside solely for MCBVI business.</p>
    <h3 align="center">Save The Date:  MCBVI 2009 Convention</h3>
    <p align="justify">     The 2009 MCBVI Convention will once again  be held at The Howard Johnson's Plaza Hotel, 255 28th street SW in Wyoming from  October 8th through the 11th.  Stay tuned  for more details in upcoming newsletter issues. </p>
    <h3 align="center">Tax Time:  Earned Income Tax Credit</h3>
    <p align="justify">     Many disabled taxpayers may be overlooking  a valuable tax credit that could increase their federal income tax refunds by  as much as $4,824. The IRS estimates that up to one in four taxpayers who  qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit - or EITC - fail to claim the credit.  Are you one of them?     You may qualify  if your income was under $41,646 last year and you, or your spouse, worked or  received disability retirement benefits under an employer plan and were under  the minimum retirement age. The amount of your EITC depends on several factors,  such as the amount of your earned income, your filing status, whether you have  children and how many, etc. Special rules apply if you have a child who is  permanently and totally disabled. <br />
      To get the credit you earned, you must 1)  file a federal income tax return and 2) claim the credit. Many communities have  volunteer income tax assistance sites or local IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers,  which will compute your EITC and prepare your return without charge. To locate  a volunteer site, call your community's 211 or 311 number for local services or  call the IRS at 1-800 906-9887.<br />
      Some states have a similar tax credit,  increasing the dollars available.  Find  more information about EITC in alternative formats for people with print  disabilities at: http://www.irs.gov<br />
      Follow the home page link to  &quot;Accessibility&quot;, then the link to &quot;Accessible IRS Tax  Products&quot; and select the appropriate link to download accessible forms or  publications. The IRS web site provides accessible electronic files in formats  including: ASCII Text (.txt), Braille Ready Format (.BRF), and Talking Tax  forms in PDF that work with MSAA compliant screen reading software and Braille  display devices.</p>
    <h3 align="center">Historic Theatre Closes:<br />
      Michigan's first MoPix system  moves<br />
      By Joe Sibley, President</h3>
    <p align="justify">     In November of 2008, it was announced that  Studio 28, a 20  screen megaplex in  Wyoming (Grand Rapids) would be closing its doors. Studio 28 opened in 1965 as  a single screen modern theatre, later expanding to 2 screens, then 6, then 12,  finally becoming the world's first 20 screen theatre, a title it held for  years. Loeks Theatres used Studio 28 to be a pioneer in the latest concepts including  all digital sound, stadium seating and much more. Studio 28 was also the home  of Michigan's first MoPix system. MoPix West Michigan raised half of the cost  of this first installation, and Loeks Theatres matched that and provided a home  for the new equipment. MoPix is a system that enables those who are blind, visually  impaired, deaf, or hard of hearing to fully enjoy first run movies right in the  theatre without changing the experience for the patrons not using the system.  MoPix West Michigan launched as a project of VIPP, the MCBVI chapter in Grand  Rapids and expanded to include many from the deaf community as well. The  project was supported by MCBVI, NFB, MCB and many other organizations and individuals.  A second similar project brought MoPix to Celebration Cinema Lansing, also  owned by Loeks. While a few other MoPix systems have been installed around the  state, progress has been delayed as theatres move from film to digital  projection and there were issues on how to make MoPix work with the digital  cinema equipment. Some of those issues have been resolved, so more Mopix systems  should be available soon.<br />
      The closing of Studio 28 was the result of  both an aging and inefficient building, and competition mainly from Loeks  Theatres own four Celebration Cinema multiplexes in the area totaling around 70  screens.<br />
      When the decision was made to close Studio  28, Loeks Theatres officials asked MoPix supporters to choose where to move the  MoPix system. The overwhelming choice was to move it to Celebration Cinema at  Rivertown Crossings Mall, primarily because of easy access to the mall by  bus.   The system was up and running just  a few days after Studio 28 closed. For additional information visit <a href="http://www.celebrationcinema.com" title="Celebration Cinema">www.celebrationcinema.com</a><a href="http://www.celebrationcinema.com"></a> and  select the Studio 28 page for historic information, or the Celebration Cinema  Rivertown page for movies showing with MoPix.</p>

    <h3 align="center">Chapter Updates</h3>
    <h3 align="center">Blue Water League Of The Blind<br />
      By Jeanette Geno, President</h3>
    <p align="justify">     Dear Friends, Last October found the BWL  busy with a harvest party, story telling and a lot of fun activities. In  November we had a thanksgiving dinner and great fellowship. We celebrated Christmas  in December with a dinner party involving Lions.  About 60 members and visitors attended.  This annual event is a lot of fun including  gift giving.  This is the second year we  have saved catering costs by organizing a pot luck resulting in good food from so  many good cooks.<br />
      We began 2009 with our annual election of  officers.  On January 15 Phyllis Magbanua  was re-elected as Vice President, Wayne, Lepiors was elected Chapter Delegate,  and Michael Geno elected for another term as BWL Treasurer.  As Chapter President I am looking forward to  working with our newly elected board.      February usually finds us busy getting ready for the annual Winter Camp  for the Blind held in a beautiful setting near Battle Creek Michigan.  Our regular meeting date that follows will  include a Valentines dinner dance.  Our chapter  is also busy producing Braille books for Southeastern Michigan emergency county  offices.  We will be embossing, bursting,  collating, binding, and packaging more than ten thousand pages of Braille.  That's after the more than 24 print pamphlets  have been converted to computer files that have been edited, proof read, and  cleared for printing.  This brings in  some much needed funds to support our very important work.  We will update you on further planned  activities in our next report.  Till  then, we hope all of you are keeping warm.</p>
    <h3 align="center">Capital Area Council of the  Blind<br />
      Donna Rose, President</h3>
    <p align="justify">     The Capital Area Council held its  Christmas party in early  December.  Everyone brought a gift to exchange $5 or  less.  Every other month or so we have a  speaker join us at our lunchtime meeting at the Gone Wired Caf‚ in  Lansing.  In January we heard from Scott  Norris on upcoming library plans to go digital.   He brought a Victor Stream to demonstrate and invited us to a once a month  computer club held on Saturdays at the library.   We also had a recent presentation by Brad Walker, new manager at WKAR  Talking Book Radio.  We talked with him  about getting involved with him on our local programming.  In June we will be taking an evening trip on  the Michigan Princess boat for dinner and dancing on the Grand River.  We are also hoping to learn salsa dancing  from a dance instructor we met at our meeting place if the details can be  worked out.  For more info on our chapter  activities you can contact president Donna Rose, 517-333-9117.</p>

    <h3 align="center">Kalamazoo Council of the Blind and  Visually Impaired<br />
      By Sherry Gordon</h3>
    <p align="justify">     December brought us the opportunity to  have our annual Christmas party. We had about 20 persons and guests in  attendance. The party was held at the T.G.I.   Fridays Restaurant on the west side of Kalamazoo.  A yummy dinner was enjoyed by all who  attended, followed by the &quot;gift game&quot;. For this game, everyone brings  a gift whose value is around $10. Each person draws a number from a  &quot;hat&quot;. The person with the number 1 picks a gift from the pile of  gifts and opens it announcing what it is.   The person with the number 2 can either &quot;steal&quot; the gift which  person #1 has or they can pick from the pile of gifts, open the gift and  announce what they have. We always have a lot of fun doing this! The really  cool thing about this game is that everyone goes home with a gift. The  &quot;hot&quot; gifts this year that everyone wanted to steal were lottery  tickets! <br />
      We also sponsored a family for Christmas.  This family included the Mom and 2 small children. We gave a whole bunch of  food items and also showered the family with gifts. What a rewarding experience!<br />
      In February, we always celebrate  Valentine's Day with a dinner. We plan to get together at a local restaurant,  have dinner and give away money prizes for the male and female who are wearing the  most red items. This is also a lot of fun! <br />
      In Kalamazoo, we are also looking forward  to our annual Kalamazoo goalball tournament. We usually have between 14-18  teams from around the U.S. who come to play. The dates for this year's tournament  are February 28 and March 1.  For more  chapter info contact Sherry Gordon at (269) 383-4144.</p>

      for Progress (VIPP)<br />
      By Deb Wild</h3>
    <p align="justify">     VIPP met twice since our last newsletter:  In November and on 01-13-2009 at the Grand Villa Restaurant on Chicago Drive.  In November we held our annual election of officers. Unfortunately our treasurer  resigned. Casey Dutmer was elected as treasurer to finish out the term. Lisa  Weber was elected as president, and Tressa Conrad was elected as secretary. We  set a date for our holiday party. In January we reorganized our  committees.  Due to cancellation We  rescheduled our holiday party which will be on Friday, January 30. One of our  members distributed cards where one can get discounts on certain prescriptions.  Another member is researching costs for a bus trip to Comerica Park to take in  a daytime Tiger game--exciting! We will attend a White Caps game on June 16 as  a fundraiser. We sold soups and subs to try to raise some money. Mary Kent is  our MCBVI delegate; Casey Dutmer is our alternate delegate. We discussed the  Braille Challenge and other items. Sadly Studio 28 closed the Sunday before  thanksgiving. Several VIPP members attended the farewell reception. The Mopix equipment  has a new home though as you can read in an earlier article in this  newsletter.  For any questions about  VIPP, feel free to e-mail me at:  <a href="mailto:dwild@altelco.net">dwild@altelco.net</a> or call me at (616)  235-8189.</p>

      By Michael Geno</p>
    <p>     Copyright July 2005, by M. Geno, all  rights reserved.  Permission is granted  to publish for this newsletter only.</p>
    <p>     Our very young grand daughters have just  left after a 10 day stay with us.  That  is why I am still in the story telling frame of mind while considering the most  important information to share with you.   Perhaps there is a favorite book or story you recall that was a comfort  before bed time.  But the story I have to  share with you now, will not comfort, and should even bring you to your feet running  to the phone, or mail box with an urgent communication to your family, friends,  and government representatives.  Here is  how the story goes.</p>
    <p>     Once there was a peaceful village of  creatures called Bennifs, all living together deep in the forest in peace and  harmony.  They helped each other, and  relied upon their collective energy and work, in a just sharing society.  They   slept snug in their warm burrows with the assurance that things would  continue tomorrow as they had for a long time.   But one morning, along with the beautiful singing of the birds, they  heard distant noises.  Yet, there were no  clouds and the sun shown with no sign of a storm or lightning.  As each day passed, These noises seem to  slowly grow louder and more disturbing.   None of the Bennifs really could tell where these strange noises came  from.  All they really knew for sure was  that the sounds grew closer and louder with each passing day.  Even so, many Bennifs in the once peaceful  community chose to ignore these harsh sounds, or thought up reasons to explain  them away.</p>
    <p>     Then one evening just before dark, one of  their watchers saw something far off that seemed unbelievable.  Just as the last of the days light faded, a  portion of the starry sky appeared where a distant tree had just been  standing.  The news of that fallen tree spread  just like lightning to many in the peaceful community of Bennifs.  The shock electrified some, with the  realization that someone was cutting down the forest:  Destroying the very trees they had long  relied upon for shelter.  There were  those who could not believe that such things could be true, because for as long  as they could remember, the forest of trees had protected them with out  fail.  These Bennifs slept that night  with their long memories to comfort and wash away any fear.  But the few who did believe, chattered and  considered until the sunrise, what could be happening?  And what should be done?  There were even some appointed to venture  close to the fallen tree and report back what they learned.</p>
    <p>     Suddenly the noise started again, even  louder than it was ever before.  So loud  that those who returned to tell what they saw, could hardly be heard.  They shouted and jumped up and down to get every  one's attention, but the noise was so close and loud now, that many panicked  while others returned to their burrows as if nothing were happening.  Others who looked up, saw more and more of the  sky appear as the trees fell closer and closer.   Then just as the sun sank into night, one huge old tree fell on the edge  of the village, crushing several homes and families under its giant weight.  Finally, there was not one who could continue  to deny the truth.  It was hard for each  Bennif to believe the awful cuts they could now see for themselves.  Others from another forest called Ticians,  were cutting down most of the beautiful trees that the Bennifs had depended  upon for so long.  Now it was too late to  stop them.</p>
    <p>     The Ticians did not rely upon the trees  the Bennifs needed for shelter, as they had trees of their own that they would  never think to cut.  The Ticians did not  care much for the Bennifs, and kept cutting even when they saw the fear and  suffering each tree they cut, crashing down on the Bennifs.  not one Bennif who ran away, could ever  return there to live happily again, because when they tried, all the trees were  down and dead.  No birds sang there, as the  sun dried up all the ground, while the wind blew it around like sand.</p>
    <p>     Some Bennifs who found other places to  hide, remembered and wondered, what could they have done to stop it?  If only they had tried when the sound of the  distant cutting first started.  Each surviving  Bennif knew now, to look for changes, and leave their comfortable places to  learn how and why they happen.  As the  years passed, they taught their young before settling down to sleep among some  new trees they found here and there, to watch and listen with care.  But some Bennifs who were so very young and  had never heard or watched the falling of something as sturdy and old as a tree,  just thought it was a scary story, and slept with out ever believing it.  These Bennifs were the ones who never watched  out for the Ticians, or listened to reports about what they were doing.  When a distant crashing sound began again one  morning so very far away, they  went  about their business as usual, and did nothing while the noise of cutting grew  louder and louder.</p>
    <p>     This story of the Bennifs and the Ticians  is only a parable, the truth concerning our government politicians and program Beneficiaries  is very real.  Yes, it is true, the  neighborhood of our government programs and services is being torn down.  The Politicians are in the woods making cuts,  and if you are one of the millions of eligible Beneficiaries dependant upon  long standing and deep rooted government funds or services, it might not be  long before things come crashing down near you.</p>
    <p>     In our last issue, Donna Rose, Chair of  our Legislative Committee, provided some warnings of things to come.  She mentioned government programs and  services important to the visually impaired,   are now being targeted for Deep funding cuts.  Serious changes are planned for Medicaid on  both a federal and state level.  Also in  jeopardy are Supplemental Security Income levels, (SSI), and Rehabilitation  Services as we have known them.</p>
    <p>     I was a Bennif myself when a very  beautiful forest was cut down.  It was  the Michigan School For The Blind in Lansing Michigan.  It was one of the best training centers of  it's kind in the world, graduating skilled and independent students for more than  100 years.  It took 90 years at the time  I left the school, to build the staff, facilities, and traditions of this fine educational  institution, to a standard of excellence now lost to future generations of  visually impaired children.  In less than  ten years Michigan politics and politicians reduced it to little more than a  nursing home for a few students.  Upon  our graduation in 1971, not one in our class could have imagined the sad fate  so soon to come for our school.  After  all, it had been running for so long, and celebrated so much tradition and  success.  When they closed that beautiful  campus after it had  been neglected and  run down, many of us mourned in disbelief.   The Visually Impaired youth of today, and perhaps the next hundred years,  will never know the benefits we enjoyed and learned from, at a residential  school like MSB.</p>
    <p>     Now, changes are being promoted that you  and I need to know about.  Each of us as  stakeholders, needs to provide input, and influence pending changes now  proposed for consideration.  I urgently  call upon MCBVI members, as well as non-members of this organization, to get  informed, and take action without delay.   If we do not get involved now, what is being set-up to replace what we are  used to, may be worse than nothing at all.   Don't ignore the cutting, or let one or a few, confront the  Ticians.  We need to unite and let the  power of our collective voice be herd louder than the noise of all the  cutting.  Together we can make a  difference, if you act now.  We are not  helpless against Politicians or Government administrators.  Just as the eating of an elephant happens  &quot;one bite at a time,&quot; or the journey of a thousand miles begins with  the first few steps, each of us must begin.   Here are some options that can help.</p>
    <p>     1.   If you are not a member of the Michigan Council Of The Blind and  Visually Impaired, (now) is the time to join.   It only costs $10 per year for a Membership At Large.</p>
    <p>     2.   Those who have already joined and support our efforts, need to talk with  family members, friends, and colleagues about how serious our goals are, and  invite them to join.  Many are just waiting  to be asked, if only you would invite them.</p>
    <p>     3.   Read and pay attention to our publications and reports.  You will be better informed and given  effective options to influence the outcome of decisions that will effect the  lives of disabled citizens for years to come.</p>
    <p>     4.   Participate in local chapter, state, and national meetings and  events.  You will find opportunities to  network and develop relationships that will inspire and strengthen you as an individual,  as well as our membership.</p>
    <p>     5.   Share your skills and resources.   Help with fund raising, writing letters, serving food, making phone  calls, are just some examples of the many supportive efforts that empower the  total influence of a grass roots organization like the MCBVI.  Every contribution in funds, words, and deeds  are important and appreciated.  I wish to  extend my personal invitation to you, now listening or reading this newsletter,  to seriously consider joining us, and attending a chapter meeting or activities  scheduled during our fall convention in Wyoming Michigan.  Don't put it off.  If we do not face this together, a cut may be  coming to a tree near you.</p>
    <p>                    Leadership Events Report<br />
      By Michael Geno</p>
    <p>     Since our Spring newsletter, your  leadership Teem has been very busy.   Tuesday May 3rd, we conducted a member orientation for resident clients  at the Michigan Commission For The Blind Training Center in Kalamazoo.  Two participants expressed an interest in getting  more involved.  Director of the center,  Melody Lindsey also attended, and called me afterwards, to express that she was  very impressed with our interesting and informative program.  We have scheduled to continue to meet with  MCB clients at the center the first Tuesday of each month.</p>
    <p>     It was also my privilege to visit with the  Detroit Northwest chapter last June.   This fine group is on the move, and now has a great restaurant where  they plan to hold regular meetings.   Those attending the cocktail hour before our banquet this October, will also  be treated to some fine entertainment from one of their newest members.  Convention plans also include a MoPix viewing  during the week end of October 7-8-9.   This is one of the many successes resulting from hard work and our  financial contributions, that will bring independence and enjoyment to the  lives of visually impaired citizens.  Our  next project is planned for Escanaba Michigan.   We will be organizing in the Upper Peninsula in the next couple of months.  The July State Board meeting enabled us to  focus on many important governmental issues, and planning for our Fall  convention activities.  Check us out, and  have fun making friends along the way.</p>
    <p>            Lansing Residents Enjoy Accessible  Buses<br />
      by: Jeff Moyer, Talking Signs,  Inc.</p>
    <p>     The process of creating access is largely  user-driven. People who require alterations to public ` places and public transportation  must advocate for those expenditures and celebrate their installations when  they happen. That is true for the fortunate individuals in the Lansing Area who  now benefit from the accessibility of Capital Area Transit Authority's buses.  All buses are equipped with Talking Sign remote infrared audible signs. The buses  are accessible to us because of advocacy. A growing number of visually disabled  citizens use the buses with increased ease, thanks to the installation of  Talking Sign transmitters. One knows what bus is coming from 100 feet away, can  quickly identify one's bus by scanning several buses at a transfer point and  easily find the door. All of these travelers celebrate the new independence and  ease of travel the system provides.</p>
    <p>     There are no doubt more of you who would  like a receiver in order to take advantage of CATA's cutting-edge  accommodation. If you want more information on how to get a receiver, or how to  get your local bus company to install this wonderful orientation system,  contact Jeff Moyer, Vice President of Talking Signs Inc., at 888 323-0626.</p>
    <p>     On the national scene, we are anxiously  awaiting the final passage of The Surface Transportation Bill, HR3, that will  include  a pilot project concerning  remote infrared audible signs, possibly on a regional, intermodal basis. Thanks  to all ACB members who havezraised their voices in support of this Federal  legislation. </p>
    <p>                        Chapter Building<br />
      By Donna Rose</p>
    <p>     No one would argue that every chapter  could use new members. Here are some ideas for advertising your chapter. The  regional libraries for the blind all produce periodic newsletters. They will likely  post short blurbs about your chapter and the contact information where people  can call to inquire. Most newspapers have community calendars which are also  free ways to post your chapter information. For a small cost you can develop a  flyer about your chapter in large print, and have it copied at an office store,  so that you can leave several at local ophthalmologists and low vision specialists  offices. Often sighted people see these and pick them up for visually impaired  family members or friends.</p>
    <p>     MCBVI now has a brand new brochure in  large print, so you can drop them off as well. You can get a supply by  contacting Joe Sontag. Copies will be available at the state convention as  well.</p>
    <p>       Also, you can print your own business cards for distribution with  brochures and flyers. The card stock for these comes in all sorts of colors and  designs and can be purchased at any office supply store for a nominal charge.  Whenever you are advertising your chapter don't forget to include the contact  information for one of your members so others can reach you. Tell us in your  next chapter report the steps you have taken to advertise your chapter and its  activities.</p>

    <p>                            Sue-Tips<br />
      By Sue Illingworth</p>
    <p>     1. To remove all pet hair from chairs and  sofa, moisten a plastic glove, rub it over the fabric, and the fur will come  off in clumps.<br />
      2. To prevent bacon or any meat grease  from clogging your drain, shape pieces of aluminum foil into a cup and place it  in the drain; pour the grease into it and discard the cup when it cools off.<br />
      3. Should you find your bag of brown sugar  hard as a rock, place a slice of apple in the bag; the apple will restore the  sugar to its original condition.<br />
      4. (This tip appeared in one of the  newsletters last fall; but with the West Nile season upon us, it bears  repeating.) Tie a piece of Bounce to your belt loop or pin it to your shirt;  the Bounce makes an excellent mosquito repellent.</p>
    <p>                  MoPix Has Arrived In Michigan<br />
      By Joe Sibley</p>
    <p>     Thanks to an agreement between a group  called MoPix West Michigan, and Jack Loeks Theatres/Jackson Entertainment, a  Grand  Rapids based movie theatre chain,  with theatres around the state, MoPix has arrived in Michigan. Auditorium 11 at  Studio 28 in Grand Rapids is now equipped for MoPix and began regular  presentation of accessible movies on July ninth. MoPix is short for motion  picture access.<br />
      MoPix West Michigan began as a project of  VIPP (Visually Impaired Persons for Progress) an MCBVI affiliate in Grand  Rapids. In the fall of 2004 the effort expanded and it became a group of it's  own with a core group of both blind and deaf people collaborating to make this  a reality. In February of this year, an agreement was made with Jack Loeks  Theatres, that we would raise $6100, half of the cost of retrofitting one  auditorium at Studio 28 for the MoPix system. Many individuals made generous  donations toward the project, and many local and statewide organizations including  NFB of Michigan, Quota Club of Grand Rapids, two Lions clubs, NAPH of Grand  Rapids, MCB, and of course MCBVI.<br />
      MoPix works in two parts. For the blind,  we bring into the theatre a wireless headset. The headset provides an excellent  description of the activity on the screen the same as DVS videos for home use.  You hear the dialogue and music through the big theatre sound system and the  description in the headset. Those who are deaf bring in to the theatre a  specially designed reflector on a gooseneck. The reflector fits in to their cup  holder and they adjust the reflector at the other end of the gooseneck so they  can see the screen, and a reflection of a large display panel on the back wall  of the auditorium which displays captioning of the movies dialogue. So far I  have received very happy comments by both visually and hearing challenged  people who have tried it out.<br />
      Jack Loeks Theatres/Jackson Entertainment  has just rebuilt their web site and it is much more accessible. You will need  to find the page for Studio 28, and by the time this newsletter is distributed  there should be a place on that page listing what the current MoPix ready  feature is. Their site is: www.bigscreenmovies.com</p>
    <p>     You can learn a lot more about MoPix  technology and coming movies that are MoPix ready at: www.mopix.org</p>
    <p>     As for MoPix West Michigan we hope to both  work toward a second installation in Grand Rapids, and to help other  communities to get MoPix in their areas. Showcase Cinemas in Flint and Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti  areas have announced that they will install a MoPix system in each of those  venues.<br />
      In the meantime, we hope those that can  will come to Grand Rapids and check it out. By the way Studio 28 is just down  the road from the Howard Johnson’s Plaza where the MCBVI convention will be held  in October.<br />
      If you have any questions at all about  MoPix or would like to make a donation please e-mail me at: joesiblwey@sbcglobal.net</p>
    <p>                         JAWS Revisited<br />
      By Donna Rose</p>
    <p>     Have you ever been annoyed because you  can't see your computer screen to check out formatting and the placement of  text? JAWS has an answer for this problem. If you push your Insert key plus the  letter f you will hear about the formatting on a particular word or line where  the cursor is located. You will be told the font and size and whether the item  is underlined. You will also hear about the alignment and whether or not an  item is centered. Now to find out where an item is placed on the page just line  up your cursor on a letter or beginning of a sentence and push the Alt key plus  delete and you will hear where any chosen character is from the left margin and  the top of your page in inches. These commands are invaluable, particularly  when you are preparing a document that has to be right, like your resume.</p>
    <p>                   July Board Meeting Summary</p>
    <p>     The last MCBVI quarterly Board meeting was  on July 16, 2005 at the Korner Kitchen Restaurant in Lansing. Most of the  topics covered were presented in committee reports which are given in that section  of your newsletter below. Additionally Casey Dutmer spoke about Commission for  the Blind (MCB) Consumer Involvement Committee (CIC) Activities. In his  position as chairperson of this committee, He expressed disappointment that  often CIC business gets set aside as &quot;community partners&quot; make  presentations and carry out discussions for the bulk of the Commissioner's  meeting. There is also concern that Consumer Involvement Committee, and  Business Enterprise Program Operators Committees reports at Commission meetings  are not always received by a quorum of Commissioners. <br />
      Other Board topics discussed involved Fund  Raising ideas, web page development with a list serve, and Fall convention  activity planning. MCBVI state Board meetings are open, to members and visitors.  Space and seating is limited at our usual meeting place, so letting us know  well in advance that observers are interested in attending, will enable us to  consider a larger suitable site when necessary.</p>
    <p>                        COMMITTEE REPORTS</p>
    <p>                      Convention Committee<br />
      Submitted by Kyle Austin,  Chairperson</p>
    <p>     Get ready for a great time again this fall  when we all get together for the MCBVI 2005 state-wide convention! This year  the convention will be held on October 6th - 9th at the Howard Johnson’s Hotel  in Wyoming, Michigan. Room rates will be $70 plus tax.<br />
      Although you will be receiving a  convention registration packet soon, some of the highlights are as follows. The  theme of this year's convention theme will be health and safety. On Saturday we  will learn about the new Medicare Part D prescription plan that goes into  effect on January 1, 2006. In November Medicare recipients will be contacted by  the government and asked to choose a plan, so this talk will prepare people for  this process. There will also be some leadership training and chapter building information,  as well as a glimpse into new aids and appliances. We are hoping to be able to  attend a movie to try out the new MoPix (Descriptive Video) system at a local  theater.<br />
      Gals get out your grass skirts and guys  get those Hawaiian shirts ironed and ready to party, because our banquet theme  will be Hawaiian. Our banquet speaker will be Jeff Moyer from Talking Signs.  You won't want to miss the fun and informative time we are planning. Convention  information and registration Toll Free Hot-Line number is (877) 254-6393.  Hope to see you there!</p>
    <p>                      Legislative Committee<br />
      By Donna Rose, Chairperson</p>
    <p>     There is a lot going on legislatively  speaking! The national budget was passed and the Medicaid program took a huge  hit as 10 billion dollars was cut from its budget. Letters were sent to Congress  from MCBVI asking Congress people not to make these cuts. Health and Human Services  Secretary Leavitt has put together a commission to decide how these cuts will  be implemented. Today I read an article by the Michigan League for Human  Services which stated that the Michigan House and Senate had both passed some serious  cuts to Medicaid. It is expected that recipients may have to pay a small  deductible for services and that some services will be limited, such as  hospitalization days and doctor visits. There have also been reports that  people who are taking care of disabled children may not continue to be eligible  for Medicaid benefits. Once these decisions have been made some of the  particulars will be posted here in an upcoming issue.<br />
      People who are receiving both Medicare and  Medicaid will see their prescription plan with Medicaid change as it will be  handled by Medicare Part D starting on January 1, 2006. The prescription coverage  is expected not to be as good as the current Medicaid drug benefits offered to  these individuals. Medicare recipients who do not receive Medicaid will be  asked if they would like to join Part D for prescription coverage.<br />
      Another astounding thing that happen since  our last issue was the announcement that many regional offices of the  Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) are planned to be closed, and services  trimmed. RSA funds and provides technical assistance to most government  rehabilitation programs in America. Once again there seems to be a push toward  combining all rehabilitation services together across disability groups,  including services for people who are blind/VI, with the excuse being that  there is a need to save money. A letter from MCBVI was sent to Ms. Spellings,  then the new director, asking her not to downsize RSA. A letter from Maria  Zacharias, Acting Director of Communications and Customer Service at RSA was  sent to one of our members, Gary Wood, in response to a letter that he sent to  Ms. Spellings regarding this issue. She said that once we needed many regional  offices, but our advanced communication trends don't require these offices any  more as so much can be done electronically. This is worrisome news at a time  when every social program is being threatened with cutbacks. More about this in  a later issue!</p>
    <p>                      Membership committee<br />
      by Donna Rose, Co-chairperson</p>
    <p>     Membership tasks are an ongoing project.  The letter writing campaign to 101 previous members who had not rejoined, which  was sent out about the time of the Spring newsletter, was successful. We  received dues for another 25 individuals which brings our current membership to  131. These member's names were sent to the national office for inclusion, but  unfortunately we didn't get credit for them at the national convention since  the deadline is March 15th. It is so very important to get those memberships in  early in the year.<br />
      If you have been wondering where your  membership cards have gone, never fear, I plan to get them to you. Please be  aware that anyone who wishes to vote during the fall convention must have their  dues in no later than August 31.  This is  so I can present the most accurate membership list to the nominations committee  prior to the convention. They will then be able to verify who is eligible to  vote.</p>
    <p>                      Nominations Committee<br />
      Submitted by Karla Fields,  Chairperson</p>
    <p>     It is time again to prepare for voting for  those offices which will have expired terms this fall. At this year's  convention we will be voting for three offices to be filled. The offices which are  expiring are First Vice President, Second Vice President and Treasurer. Donna  Rose has announced that she will once again be running for First Vice  President. If you would like to run for office or nominate someone else please  call the nominations committee chairperson, Karla Fields at (586)  465-2338.  Remember, you won't be able to  vote unless you have paid this year's dues by August 31, 2005.</p>
    <p>                     Publications Committee<br />
      By Donna Rose, Chairperson</p>
    <p>     Rosemarie Facilla has been gathering a  list of those people who have decided to receive their newsletter via email. We  currently have 34 people getting their MCBVI News in an email format. Thanks to  Rosemarie and all of those who have agreed to this. We are saving the  organization a lot of money. We currently have 15 people who will receive their  newsletter in Braille. This is down from about 35. Although this is a real  money saver we will still continue to produce the newsletter in Braille, large  print or on cassette tape for those who would like one of these formats.<br />
      The next deadline for submission of  reports and articles for the fall issue of the MCBVI News will be October 16,  2005. Please try and keep the submissions as brief as possible. You can reach  me by email at wild-rose@sbcglobal.net.</p>
    <p>                      Resolutions Committee<br />
      Last Call For Resolutions<br />
      By Chris Schumacher</p>
    <p>     The September 1st deadline for submitting  resolutions is fast approaching, so if you have anything to send us, we need to  have it now. Remember, you don't have to write it up in the form of a resolution;  we can do that for you. Items can be written in Braille, typed as a text file  on computer disk, sent by e-mail, recorded on cassette, or given to me by  phone. Remember, these resolutions are the basis of MCBVI's focus for the  coming year. So let us hear from you.</p>
    <p>                      Scholarships &amp; Grants<br />
      By Rosemarie Facilla, Chairperson</p>
    <p>     MCBVI has created a data base for mailing  out scholarship applications throughout the state of Michigan. Our deadline for  the MCBVI scholarship is usually June 15th each year. We can award up to $1000.  This year we have chosen an applicant from the Detroit Area. She is planning to  attend our state convention in October to be recognized for her scholarship  award. Look for a story about her in the fall issue of the MCBVI News.<br />
      We also have a grant program to help  people purchase aids, appliances, or adaptive technology. Anyone can apply for  a grant from MCBVI, including members. For information concerning grants or scholarships  contact Rosemarie Facilla by email at: mcbvi1@verizon.net.</p>
    <p>                       CHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS</p>
    <p>                 Blue Water League Of The Blind<br />
      by Michael Geno</p>
    <p>     The Blue Water League Of The Blind has a  number of new member activities planned in the next few months. In August we  will be hosting an Old Fashion Ice Cream Social with old time radio shows and  snacks to enjoy. This should keep us all cool, and help bring back memories and  fun.<br />
      In September we will hold a short business  meeting, followed 
      by an out door  grilled picnic with our local area Lions Club.<br />
      Our very popular Harvest Party in October  is becoming an annual tradition with fun, crafts, and surprises. You never know  just what to expect, but a lot of fun.<br />
      We meet the third Thursday of every month  accept December and July. The dates for these events are, August 18, September  15, and October 20th. Most activities begin by 6-30 PM, and are usually wrapped  up by 9 PM. For more information, contact President Jeanette Geno by calling  our home number (810) 982-0717,</p>
    <p>     There is no charge, but always good to  know ahead of time, who and how many are coming. That way, if there are prizes  and food, no one will go with out. Blue Water League members wish all a great<br />
      Fall, and looking  forward to seeing you at our Convention in October.</p>
    <p>                      Capitol Area Council<br />
      By Donna Rose, Secretary</p>
    <p>     The Capitol Area Council meets regularly,  the first Wednesday of each month, taking July and August off. In May the  met at the Korner Kitchen Restaurant and a few  new prospective members attended. The chapter will be deciding if they may want  to switch permanently to a lunch time meeting to attract more new members.  Members may gather this summer for a get-together or picnic. Our next meeting  will be on Wednesday September 7 at 7 PM. Call President Jim Moore at  517-374-8681 for the address of our meeting place.</p>
    <p>                    Detroit Northwest Chapter<br />
      By Chris Schumacher, President</p>
    <p>     I guess you could say that for the past  several months our chapter has been in a state of reorganization. We've lost a  few members but gained some new ones. Finding an adequate location for our  meetings has also been a challenge for us, but thanks to one of our new  members, we have solved that problem. So now we are focusing our attention on  such things as chapter bylaws and planning future activities for the group. To  assist us in this, President Geno attended our June meeting and did an  excellent presentation on chapter growth. We learned a lot from Mike as well as  enjoyed an afternoon of fun and fellowship.<br />
      Our chapter meets on the second Saturday  of every month for lunch at 1 p.m. At Brownie's Diner, 34250 Michigan Avenue,  in Wayne. If you're in the area, come join us. For more information please  contact George Illingworth at 313-937-9687.</p>
    <p>                 Kalamazoo Council of the Blind<br />
      &amp; Visually Impaired<br />
      by Sherry Gordon</p>
    <p>     We had a picnic at Lisa Kisiel's home on  Saturday, July 16. Almost 20 members and friends were in attendance. Each  member brought a dish-to-pass. Lisa Kisiel and Mike McAbee were the barbecue  chefs. The mingling and food was wonderful!!!<br />
      The Kalamazoo Council of the Blind and  Visually Impaired now has a web site!! I believe we are the first and only  MCBVI affiliate chapter to have a web site. The address is: www.kcbvi.org<br />
      The creation of the web site is largely  due to the work of Willie Phipps, one of our KCBVI members. Please visit the  site. There is a &quot;sign-in&quot; registry so we can see who is visiting.<br />
      The KCBVI meets monthly, September through  June, on the second Thursday. Our next regular meeting will be held on  Thursday, September 8 at 5:30 p.m. We hold our meetings at the Disability Resource  Center, located at 517 East Crosstown in Kalamazoo. For more information  contact Lisa Kisiel 269-552-4082.</p>

      by Deb Wild</p>
    <p>     VIPP is not meeting during July or August.  Kyle and Linda are working on the convention. Several of us attended a White  Caps game in early June which was a lot of fun. Several of VIPP's members have  seen the MoPix movie the Fantastic Four and are all excited about it. I hope to  see it next week. This has been a great thrill for us.<br />

        <h2>From the President</h2>

            <p class="P2"><span class="T2">By Joe Sibley</span></p>

            <p class="P4"> </p>

            <p class="P14"><span class="T2">I’m sitting here with lots of snow and ice outside my home.
            While I am no longer a fan of winter as I was when I was much younger,
            it is pretty, and I appreciate the fact that Michigan has four distinct seasons.
            Granted, winter isn’t my favorite season but it does remind us that spring is approaching soon.
            Spring is a time when a frozen world wakes up and comes back to life.
            Spring is a time for planting seeds in anticipation of the harvest later in the year.</span></p>

            <p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                Let’s think about that as it applies to MCBVI.
                Spring is the beginning of a new year, and a time for planting new seeds.
                New seeds can include a new member that you invite to a meeting,
                or perhaps a new project that we need to focus our attention on, either a problem or a new idea.
                Once these seeds are planted we all need to pitch in together to take care of the field through the season,
                fellowshipping and assisting the new members, or working together on the projects.
                We don’t want to end up with a patchy field at harvest time, with growing successes here and there,
                wouldn’t it be better if we all tend the field and we can all bring in the harvest of a very successful year
                with many accomplishments and valuable new members?
                My point here is that MCBVI is your organization, not mine or the board’s,
                it belongs to every one of us, and every one of us has a stake in bringing this organization to
                where it could be for the benefit of every blind and visually impaired citizen of Michigan and beyond.
                I know we have a lot of untapped talent in MCBVI.  
                Where can you help?
                I know what a blessing MCBVI and our members have been to me since losing my sight, let’s share that with others.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                I am also cautiously optimistic about a new spring for blind rehabilitation services in Michigan.
                I am honored to have been appointed to the Michigan Commission for Blind Persons,
                the advisory board to the new Bureau of Services for Blind Persons.
                 I am very impressed with the other members of the commission,
                 I believe that we can help to move the BSBP forward, keeping the great,
                  and tweaking the not so great, but doing so in a positive productive manner. Stay tuned.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                We have many projects on the table this year,
                bringing our website to the next level, developing our student chapter,
                seeding new chapters and building up the chapters we have.
                I’m excited about 2013 but it will take many hands to make it all work. </span>
            </p>

            <p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                You will be seeing more about our 2013 convention which will be September 12 – 15 in Lansing.
                 The theme selected is “Changing Lives, Changing Times, a Positive Attitude Makes a Difference”,
                 and it really does.
                 We are in a period of changing times in the world, both for the blind,
                 and people in general.
                 If we push forward through changing times using a positive productive approach,
                 we can accomplish so much more than with a negative critical attitude.
                 We have demonstrated that time and time again. </span>
                 <span class="T2">
                     Please join us in September, the convention is one of my favorite experiences every year,
                     and I would love to share that with you.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                Just one more thought to keep on your radar.
                At our convention in 2014 in Kalamazoo you will have to elect a new president of MCBVI,
                as my third term will end and I must step down.
                My time as your president has been a wonderful challenge and has helped me grow personally,
                and I thank you for that opportunity.
                We need to start thinking about who is getting ready to step into this role.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                So, stay warm through whatever cold weather we have left, and get ready </span>
            </p>

            <p class="Standard"><span class="T2">
                For another wonderful Michigan spring and summer!</span>
            </p>

            <p class="Standard"><span class="T2">
                Keep smiling,</span>
            </p>

                The titles are all self-explanatory, except possibly for our Guerrilla Marketing Handbook.  
                The Term Guerrilla Marketing was first coined by Jay Conrad Levinson several years ago.  
                It is defined as free and low-cost marketing and promotional methods that can be employed by firms and organizations
                with very limited budgets that will allow them to compete effectively with other firms and organizations with much larger budgets.
                In short, it is the business equivalent of David versus Goliath.

            <h2>Fundraising</h2>

            <p class="P2"><span class="T12">By: Dr. Ronald E. Milliman</span></p>

            <p class="P8"> </p>

            <p class="Standard"><span class="T12">Developing Your Organization's Financial Goals</span></p>

            <p class="P8"> </p>

            <p class="P14"><span class="T13">
                It is not unusual for the members of a non-profit organization to say something like:
                 "We should have a fundraiser of some sorts so we have more money to work with."  
                 This is really not the right approach.
                  You first must determine, specifically, what your organization needs the money for;
                  that is, does your organization need funds to enhance its grant program
                  or to be able to offer one or more student scholarships,
                  to launch a public education program?  
                  Precisely why does your organization need money?  </span></p>

            <p class="P14"><span class="T13">
                Once you have determined the reason why your organization needs the money,
                the next question to be answered in your fundraising plan is:
                "How much money will we need to generate to support or pay for the defined need?"
                The answer to this second big question will lead you to the answer to the next key question:
                "What are we going to have to do to raise the amount of money needed?"  
                Here is where you develop your very inclusive list of possible fundraising projects.  
                If all your organization needs are a few hundred dollars,
                you will have lots of viable options from which to choose, such as a
                Pancake breakfast or maybe a Chili or Spaghetti supper.</span>
                <span class="T13">
                However, if your organization needs to raise several thousand dollars,
                your range of possible options will be much more limited.  
                In this latter situation, it may require not one, but a combination of cash generating efforts,
                e.g. two or three fundraising events such as a trivia night fundraiser, a </span>
                <span class="T14">Chili Cook Off, and a Cutest baby contest with a few sponsors,
                combined with a direct mail solicitation campaign</span>
                <span class="T13"> </span></p>


            <p class="P14"><span class="T13">
                Your organization may have on-going needs requiring a continual fundraising project.  
                To meet this need, you might consider such fundraising possibilities as creating a cookbook
                and selling it through local book stores and gift shops or maybe on-going eBay listings or store
                 through which your organization sells items donated by its members and the local community.   </span></p>
            <p class="P14"><span class="T13">
                As outlined above, your organization’s clearly defined monetary goals
                help the organization to ensure it generates enough funds to fulfill its needs.
                 It is important that your financial goals be realistic, measurable, and time specific.
                 It is easy to talk, to dream, but it is critically important to be realistic.
                  Raising money usually takes a concerted effort on the part of several of your organization’s members.
                   Be realistic! Based upon your previous experiences,
                   are you likely to get the needed cooperation and effort out of your membership,
                   or is your organization like most organizations where all of the work is achieved by a very small proportion of your members.
                   Your organization’s goals need to be realistic as well.
                   Of course, it would be wonderful to be able to offer three student scholarships of $3,000 each,
                   but given the size of your group and the level of membership participation and effort you are likely to obtain
                    when trying to raise the money to fund three scholarships at $3,000 each,
                    you might need to be more realistic and reduce your goal to one scholarship funded for $2,000.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="P14"><span class="T13">
                Your goals also need to be measurable.  
                That is, you need to be able to measure your goals in terms of specific targets.  
                For instance, you might have the end objective to raise $5,000 to purchase a new piece of much needed equipment.  
                To achieve this end goal, you might launch three fundraisers over a six month period of time
                such as a trivia night fundraiser with the target of it generating $2,500;
                a Walk-A-Thon with the target of it raising another $1,500, and a </span>
                <span class="T2">Spaghetti supper targeted to bring in the final $1,000.
                 If your trivia night fundraiser ends up doing better than targeted and brings in $3,000,
                 you exceeded your goal of $2,500 by $500, and based upon your measured results,
                 it could be considered a resounding success.
                However, if the weather turns out to be cold and rainy on the day of your Walk-A-Thon,
                   and consequently, it only generates $900.00, it ends up falling short of your targeted amount by $600,
                   and it would be considered a very marginal success;
                   after all, $900 is better than nothing.
                Even still, when you net out the net revenue from the first two fundraisers,
                    you are $100 short of your targeted amount for those first two events.
                    So, now, in order for your organization to reach its needed amount of $5,000,
                     your Spaghetti supper must bring in at least $1,100.  
                Since you have been able to measure your progress toward your end goal of $5,000,
                     your members know they have to really work extra hard to generate the dollars needed from your Spaghetti supper.
                You might also have some other measurable targets like the number of people from the community you want to get involved with each event,
                 e.g. you want to bring in at least eighty people from your local community to participate in your trivia night event,
                 and you are targeting at least 60 people to take part in your walk-a-thon,
                 and another 125 people to come to your Spaghetti supper.
                These are all measurable targets that will help you determine how successful your fundraisers turn out to be.  
                Obviously, as you can see, not all targets are financial.
                It might be just as important to engage people from your community as a means of educating them about your organization,
                what it does, and the various programs it offers by telling them about your organization.
                Then, you can reinforce what you tell them by giving them your organization’s brochure and other informational materials
                about your organization and its programs. </span>

            <p class="P9"> </p>

            <p>
                Finally, your goals should be time specific.
                This means that you should have a start time and an ending date.
                It is also important to establish sub-goals with associated dates for achieving each of your sub-goals.
                For instance, let’s say your organization decides that it is going to put on a trivia night fundraiser
                 to support your student scholarship program.
                To fully accomplish this, it will require obtaining a venue in which to hold it,
                 launching a full-scale promotional effort, securing a host or spokesperson and the master of ceremonies,
                 obtain the commitment from several people to serve as volunteers,
                  seek out lots of prizes and awards,
                   nail down some tasty H'ors deurves and beverages to offer for added revenue,
                    obtain at least two, non-competing sponsors,
                     obtain a large repertoire of tested and proven trivia questions and score cards,
                      obtain a sound system, and secure a way of processing credit cards.
                Each of these aspects of the event needs to have a timeline associated with it for getting it done.
                Some of these components can be worked on simultaneously while some must precede or follow others.  
                Finding a suitable venue is a very important step that must be finalized very early in the event’s execution process.
                Next, it is important to find a master of ceremonies that is preferably a well-known personality in your community,
                 someone who is funny, with a strong, up-beat personality that will be able to keep your trivia night participants
                 entertain for the duration of the event.  
                Once these first two very important components are taken care of,
                 your group can begin focusing on creating and distributing the promotional materials,
                  flyers, posters, media releases, and perhaps even a PSA to air on local radio and TV stations.
                At the same time your promotional campaign is being worked on,
                some other members of your organization can go to local businesses to obtain donations of prizes and awards,
                 and another group of members can seek donations of the desired H'ors deurves and beverages.  
                Each of these components should have a timeline as to when they need to begin and when they should be completed.
                As you can see, some components need to be done before you can do some of the others,
                 but then, some components of the total project can be worked on simultaneously.
            </p>

    <p class="P14"><span class="T2">You should create sub-committees to work on the various components of the fundraising project. Again, using the trivia night fundraising event as an example, you could create separate sub-committees to find the venue, obtain the master of ceremonies, to get the needed prizes and awards, to handle the promotional aspects, etc. Each of your sub-committees should have someone in charge that will be responsible for getting his/her committee’s task accomplished. This is where it is vitally important to have enough competent, reliable people in your organization to manage each of the committees in a manner that will encourage the participation of all of the committee’s members.  Some sub-</span><span class="T2">committees might consist of only two or three people, while some others might involve a lot more work and hence, require a larger number of members, like five or seven.  Each committee should be as small as possible to achieve the task for which it is responsible. Small committees are much more manageable than large ones.</span></p>

            You need to find out what went really well, and what didn’t. It is important for people to provide honest feedback.
            Most participants are quite willing to share with you what they really thought went especially well or what they enjoyed and liked,
             but it is more difficult to get them to tell you what didn’t go well and what they didn’t enjoy or like.
             So, you need to let them know that it is important for you to know not only what they thought was great,
              but you also need to know what could be improved or eliminated altogether if your organization decides to do another event like it again.
              Usually, people are willing to share the negative aspects with you if they feel they are really helping you and not being perceived as
               someone just complaining. </span>

        <h3>Braille Authority Adopts UEB</h3>
        <p class="P14"><span class="T2">O
        n November 2, 2012, the Braille Authority of North America (BANA) adopted Unified English Braille (UEB).  
        UEB will eventually replace the current English Braille American Edition.</span></p>

        <p class="Standard"><span class="T2">
            UEB is based on the current literary braille code and was developed with input from many people,
            primarily braille readers, who worked to achieve an optimal balance among many key factors.
            Those factors include keeping the general-purpose literary code as its base, allowing the addition of new symbols,
             providing flexibility for change as print changes, reducing the complexity of rules,
              and allowing greater accuracy in back translation. </span></p>
        <p class="Standard"><span class="T2">
            Letters and numbers will stay the same as they are in the current literary code.
            There will be some changes to punctuation, but most will remain the same.
            Some rules for the use of contractions will change. Nine contractions will be eliminated,
             and some contractions will be used more often.
             A FAQ providing more detail about changes is available on the BANA website. </span></p>
        <p class="Standard"><span class="T2">
            After implementation, the official braille codes for the United States will be Unified English Braille;
            Nemeth Code for Mathematics and Science Notation, 1972 Revision and published updates;
            Music Braille Code, 1997; and The IPA Braille Code, 2008.</span></p>

                The Convention Bureau discussed a possible comity night
                which could be a fund-raiser and would defray convention costs.
                Details are being worked on for the Convention Bureau
                to expand marketing and then we will not need to do all of it ourselves.
                More information concerning the comity night will be announced at a later time.
                A suggestion for programming was to have someone from the Department of Treasury talk to us about solicitor’s licensing.

                    January is off to a chillier start, but with a brighter note we have made it thru our elections and all has remained the same.
                    Since our plans of attending winter camp in Battle Creek have been squashed,
                    we will now be attending a pizza party at the Dorsey Steak house instead of the fun filled week end
                    with the cereal city lions club. The BWL is currently working on a couple of fund raisers to help offset the cost of events
                    through the year.  And with a friendly reminder to all.  
                    The Blue Water League would like to invite everyone to come attend one of our functions.

                    Our chapter is in the midst of rewriting our bylaws which were lost a long time ago.  
                    We would like to eventually get a charitable nonprofit status with the IRS (501c3)
                    so donors could get a tax deduction for their donations, and so we can apply for a solicitor’s license through the State.  
                    We are hoping to approve our bylaws before June’s meeting.</span></p>

                    Thank you so much to Greg and Diane Wheby in VIPP for organizing this event with their Lions Club.
                    The front row seats were delightful and the music was lovely!
                    The Pops concert included a great variety of music;

            <h2>Summary of the MCBVI Winter Board Meeting</h2>
            <p class="P2"><span class="T2">Submitted by Deb Wild, MCBVI Secretary</span></p>

            <p class="P4"> </p><p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                The MCBVI winter board meeting conducted by teleconference was held on 01/19/13.
                It began at 10:05 a.m. and ended at 12:30 p.m.  All officers were present except Michael Geno.
                All five chapters were represented. We had a quorum.
                Both the meeting agenda and the minutes from the summer board meeting were approved.</span></p>
                <p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                    President Sibley reported we spent about $1,000.00 last year on teleconference meetings,
                    so we decided to try a non-toll free number. The </span><span class="T15">Michigan Commission for Blind Persons, </span>
                    <span class="T2">a seven-member advisory board, </span><span class="T2">had their first meeting this past Thursday, 01/17/13.
                    They divided into 3 subcommittees which will work on three priorities:
                    the Business Enterprise Program (BEP),
                    the Training Center for the Blind
                    and direct vocation rehab services.
                    That same day the </span><span class="T30">16-member Michigan Council for Rehabilitation Services board met,
                     on which another MCBVI/VIPP member, Trina Edmonson, was appointed to serve.</span></p>
                <p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                    Pam Berryman, our second vice president, passed away, so Joe appointed Sharmese Anderson,
                    president of the Kalamazoo Council, as second vice president.  </span></p>

                <p class="P14"><span class="T2">Joe discussed our web site which is out of date.
                It will be developed into a site with much more content and will be more professional looking.
                The web site will be taken out of the technology committee.
                Joe is looking for assistance with chairing grants.
                He also is looking for someone to assist to locate information/resources both on the internet and by making phone calls. </span></p>
                <p class="P14"><span class="T2">The financial report for 2012 submitted by Matt Livingston was reviewed. The 12/31/12 </span>
                <span class="T28">reconciled checking account balance was $2,361.04. The 12/31/12 total investment portfolio balance was $43,428.76.
                Total income for 2012 was $4,575.17. Total expenses for 2012 were $7,547.81. The financial report was approved as submitted. </span>
                <span class="T2">The Detroit Northwest funds were discussed.
                They could be used to form another chapter or could eventually go into the general fund. No decision was made. </span></p>
                <p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                    The proposed 2013 budget was reviewed.
                 After some discussion the proposed budget was approved as submitted.
                 We are still paying for the toll-free numbers which is the Sprint bill of $525.00.
                  It was decided that Joe talk to Michael Geno about the sprint toll-free numbers.</span></p>
                 <p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                      Regarding the 2012 convention, Casey Dutmer reported there were issues with the Best Western Plus Hotel.
                       They changed salespeople after our convention.
                       There were problems regarding what we owed the hotel.
                       Sharon and Casey went through the contract and charges and sent a check and a complete copy of a statement
                       itemizing things for which we did and did not pay. We made about $722.00, some of it from sponsors.
                       The 2013 convention will still be at the Best Western Plus Hotel in Lansing. We will </span>
                       <span class="T2">offer similar meal plans to those offered last year. Room rates will remain $79 a night.
                       The dates are 09/12 to 09/15/13. The theme is “Changing Lives, Changing Times:  A Positive Attitude Makes A Difference.”</span>
                    </p>
                <p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                    We need sponsorships from chapters and companies, a program chairman and an exhibit chairman.
                    A Comedy activity as a fundraiser on Thursday night is being explored, as is the Michigan Princess Riverboat.</span></p>
                    <p class="P14"><span class="T2">Kalamazoo has submitted a Bid for the conventions of 2014 and 2015.
                    The hotel will be the Four Points by Sheraton which is Accessible by all transportation.
                    Right now the room rates are $79.00 per night. A $500.00 deposit is required per year to reserve our spot for 2014 and 2015.
                    The executive committee approved spending $1,000.00 to send to the Sheraton to reserve the 2014 and 2015 conventions.
                    The contracts are confirmed and signed. Sponsorships are more important for the 2014 and 2015 conventions.
                    In the hospitality room we will not be able to bring much food. Most items will have to be purchased through hotel catering.
                     Whatever services we use from the hotel, such as meal options, banquet options and catering options,
                     the cost of these would go toward meeting room costs. If high enough sales, the meeting room costs would go down.
                     Tours and other details will be explored.</span></p><p class="P14"><span class="T2">We need a grants chairman.
                      We do get grant requests. There was no activity for scholarships.
                      Casey reported for legislation that there was not a lot going on directly involving the blind.
                      The executive order is in place. The Blue Cross Blue Shield bill was vetoed by the governor.
                      Michigan got $31 million for health care exchange from the federal government.
                      There were no decreases in public transportation funds.
                      ACB is involved in negotiations regarding accessible prescription labeling.
                       They are working on trying to move forward with some of the pharmacies.</span></p>

                <p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                    Membership dues are slowly coming in. We passed an amendment stating any renewing members getting their dues in late,
                     their checks will be returned. Charis will be trained in doing membership online this year.
                     Using credit cards or PayPal for collecting dues continues to be explored.</span></p>

                <p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                    We had 3 newsletters last year. We will be switching from cassettes to CDs.
                    We will invest in a simple duplicator. A priority goal is to get the new MCBVI brochure published.
                    There was nothing new to report for constitution and bylaws.
                    The amendment concerning youth membership was passed at convention.
                    Resolutions have not met yet. Accessible prescription labeling was discussed.
                    It was decided that President Sibley and Casey Dutmer, chair of legislation,
                    write a letter to the Michigan Pharmacists’ Association and attach a copy of the resolution we passed last fall.</span></p>

                <p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                    Nominations have not met yet. The offices up for election are first and 2</span>
                <span class="T31">nd</span><span class="T2"> vice president, assistant secretary, and treasurer.</span></p>

                <p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                    Regarding technology, the web site will be going to its own committee.
                    Technology updated it last year to include convention information.
                    They plan to establish programming for 3 hours a week on MCBVI radio, date and time to be determined.
                    They will continue to stream the MCBVI convention on ACB radio/world.
                    They will explore streaming the Sunday morning business meeting on MCBVI radio.
                     They are exploring training in technology skills and products for MCBVI members.</span></p>

                <p class="P14"><span class="T2">
                    There was no fund development committee report. Work was done on MCBVI convention sponsorship material.
                    Chapter charters were discussed. Each chapter can use our (501) (C3) status but needs its own solicitor’s license.
                    Bookkeeping needs to be in order. Supporting OUB was discussed.   We gave them $500.00 last year.
                    It was decided to discuss this further. Chartering a bus to attend the ACB convention in Columbus was discussed.
                    We need to decide the dates we want to attend. It was decided to refer this to the executive committee.
                    Our next board meetings are 04/20/13 and 07/20/13. </span></p>

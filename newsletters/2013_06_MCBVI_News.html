    <h2>From the President</h2>
    <p class="P4">By Joe Sibley</p>
    <p class="P9">You know you've got to love Michigan
    in the summer. I hope you are having a chance to enjoy it. As we get closer
    to another wonderful MCBVI convention in September, I am also almost ready
    to begin my final year as your president. At our convention in 2014 we will
    all elect a new president as I will have ended my third term and cannot run
    again. It's OK! This has been an amazing journey for the past five years. I
    hope I did some good for the organization, and the experience has helped me
    grow personally. Thank you for the opportunity.</p>

    <p class="P9">If I have one philosophy that I hope
    to share with everyone it is to live life and serve with an attitude of
    gratitude. We all face mighty challenges as we pass through this mortal
    life, but we all have reason to be grateful every day. I love this quote
    that Sara Conrad posted on Facebook recently:</p>

    <cite>You don't have the power to make
    life "fair," but you do have the power to make life joyful.</cite>

    <cite>-Jonathan Lockwood Huie</cite>

    <p class="Standard">I love that. If we all take a
    moment every day to count our blessings, it makes facing the challenges
    much easier to overcome. Like the old commercial said, try it you'll like
    it!</p>

    <p class="P9">Being positive is what MCBVI is about.
    I'm not saying there is never a time to raise a protest, but by my
    experience we have accomplished more with a positive productive attitude
    when challenges have come before us. Hence, the theme of our convention
    this year "Changing Times, Changing Lives, A Positive Attitude Makes A
    Difference". In addition to the usual education, fellowship, and business,
    we have added some elements of fun this year. Later in this issue you will
    see the convention information, and you will also find it on the website. I
    really hope to see you in Lansing this year.</p>

    <p class="P9">We have many wonderful people in
    MCBVI. I recently had a chance to visit the Blue Water League of the Blind,
    our chapter in Port Huron, along with my wife Mary and John Jarzyna, our
    first vice president. That chapter has an amazing history that dates back
    even before ACB was formed. We had a wonderful time, and I hope to get back
    to visit the other chapters this year as well.</p>

    <p class="P9">Remember, MCBVI is your organization.
    If you feel we need to do more in one area or another, you can step up and
    be a part of the team that makes it happen. We are also always open to
    seeding a new chapter if there is not one in your area. All you need is
    five members to organize a new chapter.</p>

    <p class="P9">Want to know more about what is going
    on at the state level? Everyone is welcome to join us at our board
    meetings; the next one is in Lansing at the Best Western Plus on Saturday
    July 20. We hold two phone conference board meetings in January and April,
    and a face to face meeting in July. Although only officers, and one
    delegate from each chapter are able to vote, everyone is welcome to
    participate and share your opinions. We also have the business meeting at
    convention where everyone gets to vote.</p>

    <p class="P9">Finally, the time has come to consider
    what MCBVI needs to speak out on in our resolutions this year. See
    malaina's article later in this issue and let the committee know what you
    think we should present to the membership in the form of a resolution. We
    speak with a loud voice when we all speak together.</p>

    <p class="P9">Anyway, Donna is waiting for this so
    she can finish the newsletter. Have a wonderful Michigan summer and we'll
    see you in Lansing in September!</p>

    <h2>What a Good Night's Sleep Can Achieve</h2>

    <p class="P4">By Malaina VanderWal </p>

    <p class="P7"></p>

    <p class="P9">Last April I began a journey to learn if I
    may be possibly afflicted with Non-24 Hour Sleep Wake disorder. This
    condition impacts individuals with no light perception. For years I
    wondered if my blindness might be why getting a decent night sleep was such
    a challenge. Why did it seem easier to sleep during the day than at night?
    I decided to find out if the study in Ann Arbor was still looking for
    participants. At this point in my life nothing would be lost and something
    wonderful could be gained.</p>

    <p class="P9">I went to Ann Arbor in April 2012. After
    finishing the interview process and paperwork, routine tests were
    completed. I went home that day with hope I would have this condition. At
    least then there would be a medical reason for my sleeping
    issues.</p>

    <p class="P9">After the month of tests was completed the
    results came back. My results were just close enough to receive the Non-24
    Hour diagnoses. If I wanted I would be able to take the medication since I
    did not qualify for the double blind portion of the study. The next time I
    went to Ann Arbor at the end of May last year I began taking
    Tasimelteon.</p>

    <p class="P9">It took a while to notice any real changes
    in my sleep quality. Some nights I did respond more than others. Some days
    I still would take naps and slept during the day. Slowly over time I found
    myself taking less naps during the day. Still other nights it seemed I fell
    back into my pattern of sleeping during the day and a little at night. Of
    course I believe some of this just might be life as well.</p>

    <p class="P9">I have not experienced many side effects
    with Tasimelteon. The most common when it occurs is possibly a crazy dream
    or borderline nightmare. It is infrequent enough though I am able to handle
    it. I experienced much worse on other sleeping aids than with
    Tasimelteon.</p>

    <p class="P9">When I wake-up during the night falling
    back to sleep is now possible! Do I feel tired during the day? Yes, but it
    is a natural progression of feeling tired as night time approaches. I am
    able to go through several days in succession without the desire to nap. My
    life has changed dramatically thanks to this experimental medication! Vanda
    Pharmaceuticals is the drug company responsible for this medication and
    drug trial.</p>

    <p class="Standard">One year has gone by and my energy
    level has changed, I feel more rested throughout the day and I sleep now at
    night! I could not ask for a greater outcome if I
    tried! I had nothing to lose and a well-rested night sleep to gain from the
    experience!</p>

    <p class="P6"></p>

    <h2>Jaws Tip of the Day</h2>

    <p class="P4">By Donna Rose</p>

    <p class="Standard"></p>

    <p class="P11">Sometimes when you are writing something, like a letter,
    trying to put together a flye or other such publication you would like to
    know about indentations in your text so you can be sure things are where
    they are supposed to be. You can turn on a feature in JAWS which will give
    you these particulars as you scan through a document. It will tell you in
    inches where the text begins. So if you are making lists, table of
    contents, an outline, or whatever, you will be able to hear where the text
    starts on any line. Just press Insert plus the letter V to go to the Quick
    settings for MS Word and you can set and reset a lot of different settings.
    For this task you will use your arrow keys to go down to Editing settings
    on the page to indentations. You can set this item to "ignore" or to
    "indicate by using the" space bar to toggle back and forth from these
    choices. This is a great feature when you need to edit a document for
    margins, tab stops, centering and whether the text is left or right
    justified. Happy yapping with JAWS!</p>

    calendars of the newspapers. I am hoping to visit a popular local morning
    radio programin August to remind folks about the
    dates and activities, and to put up flyers in prominent places around town
    too. Also I will be notifying the Bureau of Services for Persons who are
    Blind for distribution of the info as well. Have a happy summer. See you at
    the 40th annual convention.</p>


    <h3>Resolutions Report</h3>

    <p class="P4">By Malaina VanderWal</p>

    <p class="Standard"></p>

    <p>June 27th was Helen Keller's Birthday and on this
    day will be the national-call-in day for the Anne Sullivan Macy Act. This
    will insure that blind and visually impaired students receive a quality
    education and that education providers are held accountable. June
    27th is the day we can
    call and encourage congress to support this Act. Information on the
    petition can be found at the following link.</p>
    <a href="http://www.afb.org/macyact">www.AFB.org/MacyAct</a>. The American
    Foundation for the Blind has provided toll-free numbers to make it easier
    for us to locate our legislators. Here are the call-in Numbers: U.S. House
    of Representatives: 1-855-882-MACY (6229) and U.S. Senate: 1-877-959-MACY
    (6229.) As this was one of the resolutions passed at last year's convention
    I hope everyone will call-in on the 27th
    and voice their support. If anyone has a suggestion for a
    resolution that you would want us to consider please contact me at the
    following info: Email: <a href="mailto:malaina@iserv.net">malaina@iserv.net</a>
   or my cell-phone is 616-308-9644. Do not hesitate to
    contact me with any suggestions. The resolution Committee will have met by
    the time this letter is published. This is everyone's organization and it
    is up to everyone to express his or her voice. If there is a subject you
    believe MCBVI should work on then let me know. MCBVI needs everyone's
    participation not just a few individuals.

    <p class="P21"></p>

    <p>Another month is upon us and the
    Blue Water League is gearing up for an active summer. We will be having a
    walk along the Avoca trail followed by a picnic lunch at one of the picnic
    tables along the way. With the month of June we will be attending the
    Library without walls in Lansing. This should be an active and fun filled
    day with our local library. All are welcome to attend one of our functions
    and activities. Come all and enjoy the fun with us! The members of the BWL
    are working hard to put together a pancake breakfast and a night out for a
    cruise along the St. Clair River on the Huron Lady, the month and day will
    be announced when all the plans are laid. Have a safe and fun filled summer
    from The Blue Water League.</p>


    <h4>Capital Area Council of the Blind - Lansing Area</h4>

    <p class="P4">By Donna Rose</p>

    <p class="P4"></p>

    <p class="Standard">Our member Arlene Moore is currently working on rehab
    after having a hip replacement. The chapter applied for an EIN from IRS,
    but on the certificate it says we are not a nonprofit and therefore cannot
    use it to accept tax deductible donations. We had a bylaws committee meet
    to write our bylaws which were lost long ago. The committee finished them.
    Our next chapter meeting will be in August.</p>

    <p class="Standard"></p>

    <h4>KCBVI Report</h4>

    <p class="P14">By Sharmese Anderson</p>

    <p class="P15"></p>

    <p class="P13">The Kalamazoo Council of the Blind Chapter
    is selling raffle tickets from our Fundraising Committee for ($2.00) each
    or three for ($5.00.) The winning ticket will receive a ($100.00) Meijer
    Gift Card.  Every year we find community
    projects to get involved in and give back we donated money to the Susan G.
    Komen Breast Cancer Walk that was held Downtown Kalamazoo on Sunday, May
    19th. Our Annual Fun and Fellowship Picnic will be on Sunday, August 3rd,
    everyone is welcome to attend. A very hearty "Thank You" to our PR
    Committee for their submission of the Public
    Service Announcement (PSA) to our local radio stations.</p>


    <h4>VIPP Report</h4>

    <p class="P4">By Malaina VanderWal</p>


    <p class="Standard">On May22 Sharon put together a Fund-raiser held at
    Culver's. Many of us greeted customers as they entered the restaurant and
    gave them a VIPP brochure and a tootsie pop as they left. Not sure what the
    fund-raiser earned but it seemed to be steady all night. We will also be
    doing a Whitecaps fund-raiser at the end of June tickets are 15 dollars.
    The social committee planned an event to go to the Bolder Ridge Park Zoo on
    May 18th. The people who attended enjoyed
    themselves. They were able to touch the reptiles and the staff was very
    accommodating. Hopefully this can be another future activity for us! We
    will again be attending the 4th of July parade in
    Grandville which I believe will be audio described and our annual VIPP
    picnic will be on August 17th from 11:30-3:30 at
    Wedge Wood Park. Plans pertaining to national convention were discussed but
    nothing was confirmed as of the last May meeting. Dates attending were July
    5-12. Trina will be updating our membership list for September. The May
    meeting was the last one until September. We hope everyone has a great
    summer!</p>


    <h4>Summary of the MCBVI Spring 2013 Board Meeting</h4>

    <p class="P4">Submitted by Secretary Deb Wild</p>

    <p class="Standard"></p>

    <p class="P9">The MCBVI spring board meeting conducted by teleconference
    took place on Saturday, 04/20/13. It began at 10:06 a.m. an ended at 12:23
    p.m. Approximately 20 people participated. It was determined we had a
    quorum. The agenda and the summary of the MCBVI winter board meeting were
    approved as submitted. Due to a hard drive failure, this report, retrieved
    from the MCBVI newsletter, had to serve as the minutes. We need to explore
    ways to store/archive MCBVI's computer data. Long-time member Walt saumier
    passed away. A bunch of Walt's tapes from prior conventions will be sent to Joe.
    </p>

    <p class="P9">The Michigan Commission for Blind Persons met in January and
    March. There are three subcommittees: One focusing on BEP issues; another
    focusing on the Training Center for the Blind; and the third focusing on
    consumer services. Director Ed Rodgers will be coming to our
    convention.</p>

    <p class="P9">Regarding attending the ACB convention in Columbus, Ohio,
    where we again will charter a bus, the executive committee decided To
    travel on Friday, 07/05 and return Friday, 07/12/13. There already have
    been changes since this meeting. Our MCBVI convention dates are 09/12 to
    09/15/13 in Lansing.</p>

    <p class="P9">We have many members but relatively few doing the work. The
    video project we did with Ann Bratsburg is at a standstill. Forwarding our
    accessible prescriptions resolution to and working with the state
    pharmaceutical association needs to be done. Casey would like someone to
    work with him in the legislative arena. Researching resources in various
    parts of the state in response to phone calls is needed. We need a
    presidential candidate for 2014.</p>

    <p class="P9">Charis gave the financial report prepared by Matt Livingston.
    All data was as of 03/31/13. Our reconciled checking
    account balance was $2,631.66</p>

    <p class="Standard">Total investment portfolio balance was $45,280.43</p>

    <p class="Standard">Total Income from 01/01 to 03/31/13 was $1,855.15</p>

    <p class="Standard">Total Expenses was$1,584.53</p>

    <p class="Standard">Resulting Ordinary Net Gain was $270.62</p>

    <p class="Standard">The financial report was approved as submitted.</p>

    <p class="P9">Casey reported our convention will again be at the Best
    Western Plus Lansing Hotel. The theme is: "Changing Lives, Changing times:
    A Positive Attitude Makes A Difference." There may be a Thursday evening
    fundraiser at the Comedy Connection. On Friday morning there will be an
    Apple presentation with LIO and different program events Friday afternoon.
    Ed Rodgers will speak to us on Saturday. There may be several break-out
    sessions that afternoon. There will be the usual Friday night auction,
    Saturday evening banquet and Sunday morning business meeting. We may have
    the meal options of eating breakfast/lunch in the meeting room like last
    year. At our banquet we will be entertained by Jerry
    Grossman, The Human Jukebox, from Chicago, who has worked with some
    of the biggest names in entertainment for many years.</p>

    <p class="P9">We need a chair for Grants. There was one grant inquiry.
    There was no activity for scholarships.</p>

    <p class="P9">Casey reported for legislation that on the state level there
    is a lot of discussion about repealing several laws. There is nothing
    pertaining to the blind and visually impaired except HB4549 which protects
    businesses and industries from government interference. However, it does
    not protect the BEP. The bill's purpose and background need further study.
    On the federal level Social Security issues are being discussed: How they
    might change the cost of living calculations and if Social Security should
    be a part of budget cut discussions. Concerning ACB, there is the Anne
    Sullivan-Macy Act ensuring that blind and visually impaired students get
    their needs met in school/college. Concerning accessible prescription
    labels, about 33 Wal-Mart stores are doing trial runs with ScripTalk. Some
    CVS pharmacies are also participating. If you do mail orders through
    Wal-Mart, you can request ScripTalk with your prescriptions.</p>

    <p class="Standard">Each of the stores set up a toll-free number where
    people requesting this can leave a message. Envision America, who helps set
    up these toll-free numbers, is hoping more pharmacies come onboard.</p>

    <p class="P9">Our membership count for ACB is 152. Charis for the first
    time was able to submit membership information to ACB online. We lost quite
    a few members at large who did not get their memberships renewed in
    time.</p>

    <p class="P9">Regarding public relations and publications, Donna continues
    to work on the new MCBVI brochure. A temporary flier was created with
    updated contact information and our new logo. The March newsletter was sent
    out late. We hoped to produce four newsletters this year, with the next
    deadline being May one. After discussion it was decided to do three
    newsletters instead, with the deadline being moved to early June. Our
    Facebook page is more up to date, so folks can check for news there.</p>

    <p class="P9">Wayne reported there was no activity for constitution and
    bylaws. Malaina reported there was no activity for resolutions. There may
    be a break-out session at convention and an article in the next newsletter
    discussing resolution writing. Karla
    reported the offices up for election are first vice president, 2nd vice
    president, treasurer and assistant secretary. There are no candidates
    running at this time.</p>

    <p class="P9">Regarding technology, Marcia Moses and Joe Sibley reported
    for chair Jackie Boomstra. They would like to get radio streaming
    programming going on the blindmi.org web site. We are approved to stream
    the convention on ACB radio/world again this year. The Sunday morning
    business meeting will not be streamed on the ACB web site but may be on the
    blindmi.org web site. Establishing a network of people who are proficient
    in various software and iPhone and other technology issues and creating a
    resource list was mentioned.</p>

    <p class="P9">Regarding fund development, Charis has sent out sponsorship
    letters for our convention which hopefully will bring in some money. We are
    chartering a bus to Columbus. Charis is the point person. However, since
    this meeting there have been changes. We do not know the cost yet. The
    hotel is $89.00 plus tax per night. The opening session is Saturday night
    this year, with a Sunday morning general session.</p>

    <p class="P9">Regarding MCBVI's donation to OUB, last year we donated
    $500.00. In March the executive committee decided to donate $100.00 for
    expenses for a birding by ear event in Dearborn, with MCBVI being listed as
    a sponsor. About 60 people attended. CBS did a segment. This $100.00 has
    yet to be paid. There are a number of camps, including several camp in the
    box programs. It costs about $1,000.00 to sponsor and run each camp. VIPP
    has donated $500. If MCBVI donated $500, they both would be cosponsors of a
    camp. After much discussion, it was decided we would support OUB by
    donating $500.00 to cosponsor the music camp, in partnership with VIPP,
    with both MCBVI and VIPP listed as sponsors. There was discussion about the
    $100.00 donation mentioned above. Jim and Arlene Moore offered to donate
    the $100.00 to MCBVI to pay our part as one of the birding by ear sponsors.
    Charis will write two separate checks: One for $500.00 and the other for
    $100.00.</p>

    <p class="P9">Joe has been contacted by the ACB auction committee. They are
    encouraging affiliates to donate to the ACB auction. A door prize donation
    was also discussed. It was decided we would spend up to $100.00, with this
    amount covering both auction items and the MCBVI door prize, and defer the
    actual selection of items and amounts to be spent to the executive
    committee.

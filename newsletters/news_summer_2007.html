  Summer 2007</p>
<p>     The Michigan Council of the blind and  Visually Impaired unites people: to promote cultural, social, and personal  growth, as well as understanding toward progress, dignity, equality in issues regarding  blindness and visual impairment</p>

  Editor: Donna Rose</p>
<p>     The MCBVI News is published quarterly in  Braille, large print, on audio cassette and sent via email to its membership.</p>

<p>     Editor's Note:  Due to illness and a death in my family the newsletter  was postponed a bit.  I am sorry if you  submitted dated items that have since lapsed.   Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>                    From The President's Desk<br />
  By Michael Geno</p>
<p>     It is up to You! Yes, you reading this  article right now.  As a current member  of MCBVI, subscribed to receive this newsletter quarterly, now is the best time  to take a few minutes to think after reading this.  Especially those of you who regularly enjoy just  reading the contents of each issue. What I have to say here also applies to you  who may be reading this at a much later time.      You may be a person who passively takes  note of what is going on in your local chapter or MCBVI.  Do you after reading each publication, just  go on with your own personal concerns with out any further involvement?  If so ask yourself some important questions.<br />
  Do you believe much that is reported in  the Braille Forum, or in each article of this MCBVI News, really does not  involve you locally or your immediate quality of life?  Perhaps you find it difficult to see how our  struggle for independently distinguishable denominations of U.S. paper currency  impacts your own daily concerns.  After  reading about these issues, do you continue to file or throw away each  newsletter?  Have you never considered passing  it along to another, or calling to see how you can help?  If so, than my message here is especially for  you.<br />
  Think for a while about the  possibilities.  What if the MCBVI, or the  ACB were to disband?  What would life be  like if our organization had not existed or remained active for the past several  decades?  Would there even be thoughts of  protecting our dignity or rights let alone passage of a disability equal rights  bill such as the American's With Disabilities Act?  Would government lawmakers even be concerned  with adaptations or procedures that enable the visually impaired to vote  independently, gain access to rehabilitation, health, and other necessary government  services?  Would schools, training  programs, or colleges ever be concerned about fair and equal access to  education programs, information access, or testing accommodations?  Ask yourself if  employers would give much care to equal  hiring, promotion, or evaluation practices regarding the visually impaired?  Would you as a blind pedestrian even have the  consideration of drivers on the streets, or lawyers and judges in the courts regarding  your need to safely travel with a White Cane or Dog Guide?<br />
  There are many more questions  that you could speculate over involving  thousands of issues that touch each of our daily lives in some way.  The point is, life for each of us would be  much worse if only a few of these questions did not have as part of their history,  the influence of informed, involved, organized, and active members of our  organization contributing their part.<br />
  So you may be asking, what does all this  mean for me at this time?  Simply  this.  There are far too many of you who  make a choice by not making any choice at all.   Just reading, or complaining about what is going on does not represent  real involvement.  Will you always remain  comfortable with being a spectator?  It  is easy to  convince ourselves that there  will always be others who will step up, get involved, and represent the concerns  of those with vision loss.  Is this you?<br />
  Yes you hearing or reading my message  right now. Ask yourself, is it right or fair to just go on from this  newsletter, doing nothing more than I have in the past?  Will there always be others to go to  meetings, take on leadership responsibilities, or risk trying something new  like running for office?  I must tell you  that unless more of you think about this seriously, the future may not look  good for MCBVI, or the next generation of visually impaired citizens.<br />
  Our local chapters need more involved  members.  Increasing numbers of our  members are having to join as &quot;Members At Large&quot; because there is no  chapter in their local area.  Right now,  some of our most important legislative issues and state committee agendas are  not being addressed.  This is because  there is not enough involved members on a state level to assume these duties.  We need you now!  Not someone else.  Not next month, or next year.  Your brothers and sisters in our minority need  You today.  You who have also personally  experienced, or care about some one  who  has faced the challenges involving visual impairment and blindness.  You who still may be unfairly excluded by  social myths, assumptions, and discrimination regarding blindness.  Not only does MCBVI need you: You need your  involvement.  Unless you get more involved  soon, your great idea, personal experiences, and God given gifts and skills may  never blossom for the good of all.<br />
  What will you say when you reach the end  of your days, or perhaps in an afterlife, when you are challenged with measuring  the value of your life decisions and actions linked to helping others?  Even the smallest selfless gift can make such  a brighter world.  each hour of your time  or effort can lighten the load for so many.  your decision to become more involved might  not be easy, or with out risk or fear.   But please consider taking the first step today, and call a friend,  fellow member, or one of our leadership team, and talk to us about what you  would like to know more about, or try.   Don't let another day pass you by just being a spectator.  Now is the time to begin your new adventure,  and all of us being blessed because of it.</p>

  MCBVI 2007 Convention<br />

<p>     This year's MCBVI fall convention will be  held Friday through Sunday, November 2-4 in Kalamazoo.  We believe it has been 14 years since the  last MCBVI convention was held in Kalamazoo-so welcome back!!  The convention will be held at the Holiday  Inn West, just off U.S. 131 at Stadium Drive.   The special room rate will begin on the evening of November 1st.  This year's convention will highlight services  in Michigan for persons who are blind or visually impaired, specifically work  that Dr. Paul Ponchillia has done.  Activities  will begin at noon, on Friday, November 2, at Western Michigan University's  College of Health and Human Services Building-this is where the Department of  Blindness and Low Vision Studies is housed.   Lunch will be available, followed by demonstrations of adaptive  technology and goalball.  Friday evening's  opening ceremonies will begin at 7:00 pm, followed by our infamous  auction.  The auction always proves to be  fun!!<br />
  On Saturday, November 3, activities begin  at 9:00 AM with Dr. Robert Unser, Low Vision Specialist, discussing different  vision conditions.  We will have  representatives from the Michigan Commission for the Blind who will give an  &quot;MCB Update&quot;.  Lunch will be  available.  Saturday afternoon, Ron Lam  will speak to us about starting and maintaining a support group, which Ron has  done in Portage.  There will also be a  presentation by the MCBVI Executive Committee.   We will have a vendor room which will feature vendors who are blind or  visually impaired.  The vendor room will  be open from noon until 5:00 pm.  The  banquet Saturday evening will feature Dr. Paul Ponchillia as our keynote  speaker.  Sunday morning, November 4,  will be our business meeting.<br />

<p>                 Facial Vision Opens In  Detroit:<br />
  An Art Show for the Blind and  Sighted<br />
  by Suellen Hozman</p>
<p>Wayne  County Community College<br />
  The  Brown and Juanita Ford Art Gallery<br />
  1001  West Fort Street,<br />
  Detroit,  MI 48226</p>
<p>     September 13 - October 11, 2007<br />
  Opening Reception: Thursday, September 13  5:30 to 7:30 PM. 1001 West Fort Street ~ Detroit, MI 48226.  RSVP:   313-496-2570, or 313-496-2521.</p>
<p>     Imagine being invited to view a  photography exhibit and asked to close your eyes and view the art by touching  it. A collection of three-dimensional portraits line the gallery walls as patrons  pass their fingertips over the faces and feel changes in texture, identifying  smiling mouths, curled hair and thoughtful eyes.      Facial Vision is a collection of 30 plus  two- and three-dimensional black-and-white photographic portraits of people who  are visually impaired created by Suellen Hozman. The show is designed to be  enjoyed by both the sighted and blind and visually impaired. It is the only  known show of its kind.<br />
  Suellen reproduced the photos using  adaptive techniques so they can be seen with the hands of people who are  visually impaired. These tactile graphic techniques include different papers,  plaster and glass. Educational materials about the reproductive techniques are  available for patrons at the show.      The show opened at Creole Gallery in  Lansing's Old Town in July, 2006 and it has had people talking ever since.  It is currently on tour in Michigan.  Civil rights are all about equitable  opportunity for people who historically are denied access, Suellen says. I want  to change that for people who are blind and visually impaired.<br />
  The show has three goals:<br />
  First, to welcome people who are visually  impaired to an art show.<br />
  Second, to educate people that creative  talent and technologies are available to both the able and disabled.<br />
  Third, to stimulate conversation and  encourage people who work with two- and three-dimensional media in engineering,  graphic arts and forensics to offer their talents and expertise to people who are  blind.</p>
<p>     Facial Vision is a collaborative effort  with many people and companies including Craig Mitchell Smith, a glass artist,  ViewPlus Technologies Inc. and 3darttopart.com.<br />
  Suellen is committed to traveling with the  show in the hopes of promoting the conversation that will enhance technology  choices for the blind and visually impaired.   Additional photos are added of people from each new location.<br />
  Please come to see the exhibit at Wayne  County Community College.  Visit my web site  for more information: www.facialvision.com.</p>

  Farewell to a good friend<br />
  By Susan Ponchillia and<br />
  Sherry Gordon</p>
<p>     Elizabeth &quot;Libby&quot; Lennon, long  time resident of Kalamazoo, Michigan and a member of the Kalamazoo Council of  the Blind and Visually Impaired, passed away at Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo  on May 11, 2007.  Libby was 97 years  young!<br />
  Born in Chicago on April 29, 1910, Libby  lost sight in one eye at about the age of eight due to an accident. Her  determination to become an educator for persons who are blind eventually led  her to Western Michigan University in 1967, after previously having an impressive  teaching and administrative career in programs for blind persons in Indiana,  Massachusetts, North Carolina and Montana. She also reached beyond U.S. borders  and traveled and taught in England and Australia.  Libby retired from WMU in 1978 as an  assistant professor in the blind rehabilitation program.<br />
  Aside from her teaching and being a  life-long learner, Libby was an active member of the American Council of the  Blind for many years, being a contributing editor to the Braille Forum, as well  as the writer for the column &quot;Here and There&quot;.  Libby enjoyed attending many national ACB  conventions and in traveling around the world.   Libby was also an active member of the Michigan Council of the Blind and  Visually Impaired and the Kalamazoo council of the Blind and Visually Impaired.<br />
  Libby was active in many organizations,  boards and committees including being a founding member of the Kalamazoo  Disability Resource Center and co-founder of the Shepard's Center of Greater Kalamazoo,  which offered ecumenical programs for homebound seniors.  Libby served on the Board of the Voluntary  Action Center of Greater Kalamazoo, was an advisory member of the City of  Kalamazoo's Advisory Committee for the Coover Recreational Center and had a longtime  involvement with the Michigan Commission for the Blind.  Libby was a member and former secretary for  the Michigan Blind Athletic Association, always advocating that persons who are  blind or visually impaired be involved in sports and recreational activities.<br />
  In  recognition of her work in her community, Libby was named the Handicapped  Professional Woman of the Year in 1971, and in 2002 she received the  prestigious Irving S. Gilmore Lifetime Achievement Award.<br />
  We dearly miss our friend, Libby.  She was a very intelligent lady who had  boundless energy and great ideas for making things happen.  Libby's inspiration has influenced so many,  many persons who are blind or visually impaired over the years that we are not able  to name every achievement Libby accomplished-only to say her thoughts and  dreams will live with us for a very long time!</p>
<p>            Food For Thought - Angel Food  Ministries<br />
  By Donna Rose</p>
<p>     In my travels as a social worker I am  always learning of new resources to share with others.  This summer I learned about Angel Food  Ministries, a national non profit non denominational organization which offers  low cost food to anyone who needs it.  This  program is financially sponsored by the USDA. There are no papers to fill out  or questions about eligibility to answer.  Anyone is welcome to buy food from this  discount program.  The food is not  surplus or second hand, but fresh, restaurant quality meats, dairy, frozen  vegetables fruits and desserts. For $25 for a medium size box you receive $50  worth of food that can feed one person for approximately one month.  And there are also  special bonus steak and pork boxes you can  buy after purchasing a regular unit for an additional $18.  <br />
  I checked their web site and there is at  least one Angel Food site in each of our lower peninsula chapter cities, more  in Detroit and Lansing.  The menu for  September is: (1) 4 lb. IQF (quick frozen) Leg Quarters, (1) 24 oz. Beef Back  Ribs, (1) 1 lb. 80/20 Lean Ground Beef, (1) 2 lb. Breaded Chicken Tenders, (4)  6 oz. Bone in Pork Chops, (1) 1 lb. Ground Turkey, (1) 18 oz. Stuffed Manicotti  (Cheese), (1) 12 oz. Smoked Sausage, (1) Betty Crocker Seasoned Potatoes, (1) 7  oz. Cheeseburger Dinner, (1) 16 oz. Green Beans, (1) 16 oz. Baby Carrots, (1) 2  lb. Onions, (1) 1 lb. Pinto Beans, (1) 1 lb. Rice, (1) 7 oz. Blueberry Muffin  Mix, (1) 10 ct. Home-style Waffles, (1) Dessert Item.</p>
<p>     The sites are in churches in 32 states and  pickup is once a month.  You must order  the number of units and bonus boxes you would like by the deadline at your site  at the beginning of each month.  The web  site is, www.angelfoodministries.com, and they have a hotline at  877-foodministry where you can learn more if you don't have web access.  Angel Food sites and menus are listed on  their web site, or can be obtained by calling the hotline.</p>

<p>               Computer Conference Call and  Learn<br />
  By Donna Rose</p>
<p>     Several people have asked me about ways to  do some time saving items on the computer and now here is your chance to  learn.  In September we will hold our  first conference call to teach members how to make and print out address  labels.   Labels are a great way to  address those Christmas cards or for party invitations because you can set up  as many as you want to use for quicker mailings. And the best part is you can  save your label file to use next year and even add to it.  You can also print a whole page of the same  labels to make your own return address labels. It is even possible to just print  out a single label to send a card to a friend.   Once you learn this simple method you will wonder why you didn't do it sooner.<br />
  You will sit at your computer in your own  comfy environment while connected to your telephone with others on one of our conference  lines.  I will be able to enroll four  people for this first session.   Participants will need to have MS Word installed on their computer and  be able to create and save a document.   We will be using Avery number 8160 address labels, but you won't need to  purchase these for training purposes.   Once you learn how to set up labels you will know how to print out  business and post cards as well.  Anyone  who is interested should contact me as I will need to do some screening to make  sure that the first four people that attend this computer training have similar  skill levels.  I will also need to give  out our conference phone number and code that will be set up specifically for  this purpose.  <br />
  The first class will take place on  Saturday October 6th from 11 AM until 1 PM, or until we are finished.  Call me to register at 517-333-9117 or via my  email address.  If I get enough response  we will hold a second session for four more participants.</p>
<p>            Camp Tuhsmeheta Is Having An  Awesome Year<br />
  By George Wurtzel, Lansing  Chapter</p>
<p>     This year's elementary program was  phenomenally successful. The 2006 elementary program had 4 campers, this year  we had 20! The rest of our summer programs have either reached capacity or  almost. Now with the total elimination of the Michigan School for the Blind,  promoting enrichment programs such as ours that teach skills of blindness are  more important than ever. OUB will continue to pursue our goal that no blind  child is left behind. Thank you to all who support Camp T and it's programming!<br />
  The grand finale of our summer programs is  our 3rd Annual GPS event. &quot;World at Your Feet&quot; GPS event will be held  Aug. 15-19, 2007. Wednesday, Aug. 15th is expressly for O&amp;M Teachers,  TCBVI, RT's and other professionals in the field of blindness education. Please  go to www.campt.org for more information. This event is open to all ages!<br />
  Please check our website often for updates  and view our Camp T video blogs! These video blogs are very popular with the  parents and teachers of our campers. We are already thinking of programs for  next year and looking for future campers and staff.</p>

<p>     Debra Bonde, Founder and Executive  Director of Seedlings Braille Books for Children, is a finalist for the  &quot;Stand On A Better World&quot; award from Mannington Mills, a leading  manufacturer of fine flooring.   Mannington Mills has recognized Ms. Bonde for her work in furthering the  non-profit mission of increasing Braille literacy by making affordable braille  books available for blind children. <br />
  Mannington, celebrates women across the  U.S. who are making a positive impact in their communities or the world at  large by offering a chance to win a Stand On A Better World Award in one of three  categories: local, national, and global.   One winner will be chosen in each award category, and one of those three  will be the grand-prize recipient, receiving $25,000 for the charity of her choice.  The other two will receive $10,000 for their  chosen charities.   <br />
  For the first time, Mannington Mills has  added an additional award category, Better Your World, which allows an  opportunity for the public to cast a vote online for one of the finalists from August  15 through September 7.  The winner of  the Better Your World Award will receive $10,000 for her charity. <br />
  Please go to:<br />
  <a href="http://www.standonabetterworld.com/vote/">http://www.standonabetterworld.com/vote/</a> to cast your vote for Debra Bonde (in the National Section.) Only one vote is  allowed per person.<br />
  The positive publicity from this award can  only help the cause of braille literacy! Seedlings' goal is to help raise the  literacy rate among children who are blind by providing access to the wonderful  literature that is readily available to sighted children. Through Seedlings,  Debra has been bringing the joy of reading to countless children worldwide for  23 years, helping them to read and succeed. We applaud her for bringing the  written word to blind children locally and worldwide. <br />
  If you would be so kind as to forward this  to others who might be willing to take a few seconds to cast a vote in favor of  Debra Bonde and braille literacy, we would be most grateful!</p>
<p>                        Flying Blind Tech</p>
<p>     There is a new web site for all of you  techies out there, or those of you who would like to be.  It is called Flying Blind LLC.  It is loaded with adaptive technology news and  a newsletter.  Visit <a href="http://www.flying-blind.com">www.flying-blind.com</a> (Note that there is  a dash between flying and the word blind)</p>
<p>                   (ICE) In Case of Emergency</p>
<p>     If you are carrying a cell phone and were  ever in an accident the paramedics would have access to all your friends and  family via the phone book in your cell phone.   That is, if you have a phone that is adapted so you can use the phone  book, as many are today.  Unfortunately  they wouldn't know which of these entries to call.  There is a new trend to enter your emergency  contact person in your cell phone under the name of ICE, which stands for  &quot;In Case of Emergency&quot;.<br />
  The idea was thought up by a paramedic who  found that when he went to the scenes of accidents, there were always mobile  phones belonging to the sick or injured person, but they didn't know which number  to call. He therefore thought it would be a good idea to have a nationally  recognized name for this purpose. In an emergency situation, Emergency Service  personnel and hospital Staff would be able to quickly contact the right person  by simply dialing the number you have stored as &quot;ICE&quot;.</p>
<p>                        Committee Reports</p>
<p>                           Membership<br />
  Donna Rose, Co-Chair</p>
<p>     Membership is always busy and in  transition as names are added and addresses are changed.  I need to remind chapters we will stop accepting  new memberships on September 15, 2007 so that we can work on the verification  list for our upcoming elections.  Those  who have not paid their dues by this date will not be permitted to vote at our  state convention in November.  As I said  in our last issue, I will no longer be working on the membership committee with  John McMahon.  It is vital that we find  someone who is willing to perform in this capacity.  It would be helpful if this individual has  computer skills and is available for the training on creating mailing labels.</p>
<p>                           Nominations</p>
<p>     Thus far the executive committee has  learned that Rosemarie Facilla will be running for the vacated first vice  president position, and incumbent Jim Moore will be running against Jennie Baly  for second vice president.  we currently  do not know of a candidate for assistant treasurer.  We need some new blood on our executive  board.  If you care about the causes of  those who are blind or visually impaired please step forward and become a candidate.  Let's make this election interesting and  fun.  One person can make a difference!!</p>
<p>                          Publications<br />
  Donna Rose, Chairperson and  Editor</p>
<p>     I love putting together this newsletter  and I hope to continue doing it after the elections.  We are going to be working harder to get some  formats to you more timely.  If you hear  about scholarship opportunities, please let me know as soon as possible.  I would like to get some in the November  newsletter.  Our deadline for that issue  will have to be just before the convention, October 29th, to avoid working  through the Thanksgiving holiday.   Convention reports and minutes can be submitted just after the  convention if they are to be included in that issue.  We may not publish our resolutions until the  winter issue and they may be printed in an abridged format, with complete  copies available to anyone who request them.<br />
  You may notice that there are some  committee reports and chapter updates missing from this issue.  If you are a committee chairperson or want to  submit a chapter update, it is primarily up to you to contact me with the  report for our newsletter.  I do send out  an email reminder, but I don't have time to contact individuals to track down  their submissions.  Please be diligent  about getting things to me by the due date so that our newsletter will be interesting.  Thank you. </p>
<p>                        Public Relations<br />
  Donna Rose, Chairperson</p>
<p>     In late August or early September I will  be contacting newspapers throughout Michigan with a press release describing  our 2007 state convention.  I will be  listing our convention toll free number as well as our toll free information  line.  If you want me to list a contact  number for someone in your chapter when I contact your local papers, please let  me know and I will include it in this publicity.  </p>
<p>                          Resolutions <br />

<p>     Little did we know that our conference  call on April 24th would be the last time we would be working with  Sue Illingworth.  We will truly miss her  way with words and her wealth of knowledge about the history of MCBVI and  ACB.  In that hour-and-a-half meeting she  spoke of how she was looking forward to going to the ACB convention, answered  some of our questions about what that convention is like and encouraged us  enthusiastically to attend one.  At our  June meeting we discussed whether we would replace her on our committee and  decided not to consider that until after the MCBVI convention.  No ideas or drafts of any resolutions have  been submitted to us, so we need to hear from you.  Since we now know that the dates for the  convention have been moved up, we will also move the deadline for submissions  up to September 15th.  Please also note  that since our last newsletter, I have a new E-mail address which is  chrisanne7452@sbcglobal.net.  Feel free  to contact me or any member of the committee-Neal Freeling, Deb Wild, or Casey Dutmer-with  any drafts of or ideas for resolutions in Braille, on cassette or computer  disk, or by E-mail.  MCBVI is your organization,  and these resolutions guide its activities for the coming year.  So let us hear your concerns and thoughts  about the issues we should consider.</p>

  Blue Water League of the Blind<br />
  By Jeanette Geno </p>
<p>     The Blue Water League of the Blind has  been busy this summer.  In July we  attended a picnic visit with our Sarnia White Cane Club friends in Canada. In  August we plan to host an Ice Cream Social after enjoying the activity centers  of our local Peace Mobile.  The Peace  Mobile is a very creative fun way to learn and experience concepts of conflict  resolution and world peace in different activities.  The BWL has been working with this program to  make many of their activity centers accessible to the visually impaired. The  event is free, and open to both sighted as well as visually impaired  visitors.  In September, we will be  co-sponsoring a picnic for the blind with the Port Huron Host Lions Club.  We hope to see all our friends and some new  visitors enjoying good food and fun Thursday September 20.  Please call us for more details at (810) 982-0717.</p>
<p>                Capital Area Council of the  Blind<br />
  By Donna Rose</p>
<p>     The Capital Area Council of the Blind now  has 25 members.  Earlier this year we  asked Wal-Mart for a contribution to use toward a retro oldies dinner/dance  cruise on the restored Michigan Princess Riverboat which goes up and down the  Grand River.  We paid for 15 members and  five volunteers.  The rib dinner was  great and our members danced their feet off!   In July we had a dinner and adaptive game night at the Gone Wired Café  in Lansing.  It was well attended.  We discovered that there were a lot of people  who wanted to play scrabble, so next time we will bring more than one scrabble game.<br />
  We still continue to sell Rada knives and  want to remind readers that they can order items, such as knives, quick mixes,  soy candles, kitchen utensils and much more,   from Rada online and our chapter will receive a portion of every  sale.  You can visit their web site at  www.helpourfundraiser.com, enter internet order number 500706 and password  6411.  <br />
  On June 21st our member, JoAnn Sheehan,  received the Melvin Jones Award for her volunteer efforts through the Lion's  Club and throughout her community.  JoAnn  is a member of the Bretton Woods Lion's Club.<br />
  As you read in the article above, our  member Suellen Hozman is opening her tactile photography show, Facial Vision,  at Wayne County Community College in Detroit in September.  Suellen has also been nominated for the Touch  of Genius Award sponsored by the National Braille Press for this project.  If she wins this award she will receive  $20,000 to use toward taking her exhibit to other communities.  We wish her all the best in this  endeavor.  I attended her original show  in Lansing and it was extremely enjoyable.</p>

<p>                    Detroit Northwest Chapter<br />
  By Chris Schumacher, President</p>
<p>     Our June meeting was a difficult one as it  was our first time coming together as a chapter after Sue Illingworth's  death.  We conducted no business as our  purpose was to lend our support to George and remember Sue.  In July we celebrated with Carlton George when  he announced that he is cancer free, and we were very grateful and pleased to  accept Tyrone Hamilton's donation of $200 to our chapter from the sale of his  CD's.  I also told the group about the events  and issues I heard discussed via ACB radio at the ACB convention.  Our meetings are held on the second Saturday  of the month at Brownie's Diner in Wayne.   Contact George Illingworth for more information and directions.  George's new phone number is 734-326-4770.</p>

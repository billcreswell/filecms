    <p>                    From The President's Desk<br />
      By Michael Geno</p>
    <p>     Jeanette and I would like to thank each of  you who have expressed your kind thoughts in calls and cards, along with your prayers  for our healing. Jeanette's brain tumor does not seem to be life threatening  for now, and its recent growth may be controlled by radiation treatment.  My surgery was successful, but not performed  in time to remove all the cancer.  I am  told that there is still a need for radiation or other treatment.  At present I am healing and getting  stronger.  No further treatment can begin  until I am healed enough to withstand the side effects and damage radiation  causes.  Please feel free to call or  E-mail us for updates.  I am thankful to  be able to serve you full time again as President for as long as my health  permits.</p>
    <p>     The greek god Janus had two faces.  One looking forward, and the other looking  back into the past.  Like Janus, I have  two prospectives to compare in this report.   I just had the fascinating experience of listening to a 25 year old tape  of &quot;The M A B News&quot; sent to our members in May of 1981.  We were then known as the Michigan  Association Of The Blind publishing this newsletter three times annually on the  25th of January, May, and September.  The  May 1981 MAB News was Volume 8 #2, implying that if there were no lapses in the  deadline schedule, volume one issue 1 may have been published in January of  1974.<br />
      In 1981 Jeanette Merris was President,  with William Rush as First Vice President, Betty Jacobs Second Vice, Elisabeth  Lennon Secretary, Robert Engle Treasurer, and Lina Silvester relieving Eugene  Saumier as Editor.  The 1981 Newsletter  table of contents included for example: Message From The President, Letter From  The Editor, Comments On MAB Membership, Thank You Douglas Camerin (then  narrator of the taped newsletter, Bell Telephone News Release, Fundraising,  Leadership workshop, Convention Report, and Dick Estel WKAR feature article, just  to name a few.  Many of the standard  features reported in our newsletter 25 years ago are much the same as you see  in this publication today.  However,  there were a few interesting differences.   The 28 large print page 1981 issue of the MAB News also included regular  features under Titles such as, &quot;Aunt Lina's Kitchen,&quot; &quot;Hobbies  And Avocations,&quot; and &quot;Humor.&quot;   The newsletter was written, edited, and produced to professional  quality, very informative, and entertaining.<br />
      The standard of excellence  set by this organization as reflected in the  publication of our newsletters, adds to the hope and enthusiasm I have for  present MCBVI initiatives.  The past quarter  century of MCBVI activities, energy, and leadership, also challenges me with a  number of questions.  Now that we are  growing in membership, can we reach and surpass in the future the involvement  generated back then?  Can we remain  strong and active?  what will our leaders  and members say about us, our efforts, and this issue 25 years from now?  Finally, how will anyone be able to look into  the past if no one takes on the job of Historian and archive and preserve  information and documents of our organization over time?  I believe we need to formally assign a Member  or committee to protect and preserve for future generations and members, the  details and history generated by our efforts and writing.  Our leaders of 25 years ago would be proud of  present accomplishments, and the historic steps we are now taking.  Of all that we have accomplished during my  term as president, what will take place upon the distribution of this issue of  MCBVI Newsletter, will be the achievement of one of our most important  goals.  I am proud to announce in this  report that the MCBVI web site is now accessible on the World Wide Web!  This means that we have caught up with  international communications and computer technology. The potential benefits  are almost limitless, and will open doors not yet imagined by those of us who  grew up at a time when black and white TV, manual typewriters, and dial  telephones were considered modern.  You  can now visit the MCBVI Home Page at the following web address.  http://michivision.org<br />
      Willie Phipps Chair of our newly formed  Technology Committee will provide more details in his report later in this  newsletter.  We are thankful to have the  dedicated and skilled efforts of Willie and each of the Tech Committee members.  Joe Sontag Pr Chairman and also member of the Technology Committee, has agreed  to moderate our new MCBVI List Serve which should be up and running later this year.  For those who do not know about or use a  &quot;List Serve,&quot; it enables computer users sending and receiving  messages to post information to a group of others signed up or subscribed to  the list.  This creates a community of  participants who can regularly communicate and share opinions and late breaking  news and information.  These kinds of  changes in our society because of computer communications, have brought distant  people together, and strengthened the networks of many mutually interested  stakeholders.  We hope that you will  check out this historic opening of our cyber home, and provide input as to how  we can build it even better.  There will  be valuable and interesting information and surprises to enjoy while there,  including the audio archive of this newsletter, and others recorded as far back  as 1981.  We will have interesting and  helpful information items posted regularly, along with links to other resources  of keen interest to the visually impaired.   You will also be able to listen to recordings of meetings, and messages from  our leaders near and far.  We intend to  be innovative with fun and new features.   Our home page will be your fastest source of upcoming events, important  news, and fascinating fun features of interest to the blind, their family  members, and friends.  The success of all  our efforts, depends on your input and involvement.  Please let Willie and your leadership know  what you think, and how you feel about these and other initiatives.<br />
      This brings me to a concluding observation  in this Spring 2006 President's report.   Posting information to our new web page, will help us begin to organize  and preserve the images, sounds, and writing of this organization for future  members and leaders.  I hope you will  check it out, and contribute your part to this exciting chapter in the history  of The Michigan Council Of The Blind.</p>
    <p>                  MCBVI Fall Convention Update<br />
      By Kyle Austin</p>
    <p>     Join us for the MCBVI convention on  October 5/8 2006. We will be holding the convention again at the Howard  Johnson's Hotel in Wyoming MI. The address of the hotel is 255 28th SW in  Wyoming. For all rooms the rate is $84.75. This includes taxes. Make reservations  directly with the hotel by calling (616)-241-6444.</p>
    <p>     The theme for this year's convention is:  Technology and you. We plan to have at least 14 vendors who be exhibiting  Friday from noon until five p.m. Many of the vendors will stay over on Saturday  for informational sessions and have the exhibits during the afternoon. We will  have other vendors as well.</p>
    <p>     Saturday will be a western night. Plan on  dressing the western way. A good time will be had by all.</p>
    <p>     Don't forget the auction Friday night.  Only new items please. This is always a lot of fun and a nice fund raiser for  MCBVI. <br />
      The registration information will be  coming out in July, and Linda will still register you at that time or answer  questions by phone at (877) 254-6393 (no calls after 9 PM please).  See you in October!</p>
    <p>               Unique Accessible Photographic  Art<br />
      Show for Blind And Sighted</p>
    <p>     Facial Vision is a hands-on art show that  can be equally enjoyed by people who are blind and sighted alike. It features portraits  that have been made accessible through various adaptive and non-adaptive  techniques. The show will open at the Creole Gallery in Lansing, Michigan, on  July 9, 2006 and run until July 31.</p>
    <p>     The show began with twenty-eight  black-and-white photographic portraits of people who are blind taken by Suellen  Hozman. The photographs were then reproduced using adaptive and non-adaptive technological  techniques so that they can be seen by people who are blind and sighted with  their hands. These tactile graphic techniques include different papers,  plaster, and glass. Educational materials about the different production  techniques will be available at the show.</p>
    <p>     The opening reception for the show will be  Sunday, July 9 from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM at the Creole Gallery, located at 1218  N. Turner in Lansing's Old Town. There is a bus stop in front of the gallery. Non-opening  day viewing times are Thursday through Saturday 11:00 AM to 6:00 PM and Sundays  noon to 4:00 PM. The show may be independently seen or you may choose to give  one of our guides the opportunity to make a friend and be helpful.</p>
    <p>     Suellen Hozman, the creator of the show,  believes that Civil rights are all about equitable opportunity for people who historically  are denied access. She says I want to change that for people who are blind and  visually impaired.</p>
    <p>     The show has three goals:<br />
      First  that people who are blind are finally welcomed to an art show.  Second, that it is an educational experience  for people to learn that talent and technology is out there that is currently  not available to the blind.  Third, to  stimulate a conversation with people in the 2D to 3D engineering, material  science and forensic world to be interested in offering their talents to people  who are blind to improve academic and life choices.<br />

    <p>          Writing for Publication or for Social  Change<br />
      By Donna Rose</p>
    <p>     In the spring of 2005 I was invited by the  National Kidney Foundation to attend a four day governmental advocacy training workshop  in Washington, DC. I was asked back to speak to Congressional leaders this  month. Among the advocacy skills that were taught were writing letters to  Congress people to convince them to support a variety of kidney disease health  initiatives. I will share with you here what I learned and have practiced throughout  the past year.</p>
    <p>     If you want to be heard your message has  to be brief and limited to the one topic at hand. Government officials are extremely  busy, sometimes reading and writing long bills that are hundreds of pages long.  There time and attention is particularly limited due to the nature of their  work. Your brevity will pay off. Read and reread your text to cut out and edit  your language to make it as concise as possible. For example, I am writing to  explain why you should support can be cut down to, I am asking for your support  In the first case there are 9 words used, but in the second only 6. If you edit  your whole document you will likely get your point across quickly for the  reader to read and understand the issue without throwing your letter down and  responding to you with a form letter.</p>
    <p>     I often write opinion pieces that are  published to the editor of my local paper. The secret to this is to stay within  the publications publishing guidelines. For instance, the Lansing State Journal  will not accept letters over 150 words, and they mean it! Whenever you write to  any publication, check out their guidelines prior to writing, and stick to  them. Never forget to spell check your document. Misspellings will always  detract from your message.</p>
    <p>     When writing a letter as an advocate make  sure you are writing to the right person about a problem, i.e. someone who has  the power to do something about it. Often follow-up is necessary. Always include  your name, address and telephone number on any correspondence.</p>
    <p>     Letter and editorial/article writing is an  important way to start the wheels of social change. If you abide by a few  simple rules your efforts will be much more effective and you alone could make  a difference!</p>
    <p>                MCBVI Establishes Tech  Committee<br />
      and New Web Site<br />
      By Willie Phipps</p>
    <p>     The technology committee was formed over  six months ago by President Mike Geno to help make MCBVI members aware of technologies  available and how to access them, provide an accessible source for state-local  blind related information, and to expand the presence of MCBVI.  This six-member committee consist of Joe  Sibley, Joe Sontag, Jackie Boomstra, Rhonda Selby, Willie Phipps: committee  chairperson, and President Mike Geno.</p>
    <p>     We have been working on a few projects  that we think you all will be excited about. Our current project is the  Michigan Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired web site http://michivision.org.</p>
    <p>     At Michivision.org, you will find a fully  accessible web site containing links to legislative news, MCBVI publications,  helpful life-coping tips, and more. Fill out a membership application, print it  out, mail it in. Listen to conventions you've missed. Contact a board member.  Do it all a michivision.org. There will be an area on the site for visitors to  offer comments and suggestions. These suggestions will be collected  periodically to be reviewed by the Tech committee. We encourage you to follow  that link and type in those suggestions. Help this site grow in to an  indispensable resource.  We hope to have  things up and running mid-June early July.   That is just one of the exciting things coming up.  Your comments and suggestions are welcome on  this and future projects.

      More JAWS Tips<br />
      By Donna Rose</p>
    <p>     When using web pages with JAWS it is often  tricky to get combo boxes to work properly. While located on a combo box, press  enter to turn on forms mode, and quickly press the Alt plus the down arrow. Now  you can navigate the combo box using your up and down arrow keys without the  next page being loaded before you have made your choice. When you have reached  the selection you want you can press enter or tab down to the button on the  page that will enter the information and take you to the next page.</p>
    <p>                      United Cerebral Palsy<br />
      Releases Consumer Guide</p>
    <p>     United Cerebral Palsy, one of the nation's  largest health charities, announced the release of Navigating the Medicare Part  D Prescription Drug Coverage Program: A Guide for People with Disabilities,  Benefits Counselors, Disability Organizations and Others on Ensuring Adequate  and Appropriate Access to Prescription Drugs. The guide serves as a follow-up  and companion document to Understanding Changes in Prescription Drug Coverage  for People with Disabilities on Medicare, a consumer guide written by the same authors  in 2005.</p>
    <p>     Free copies of the guide are available in  PDF, Microsoft Word and HTML file formats online at www.ucp.org.  For more information contact Jim Baker at  (202) 973-7114.</p>
    <p>                Michigan's Own Creates  Disability<br />
      Web Site and Podcast</p>
    <p>     Michigan's own, Larry Wanger, has launched  a new website and podcast for people with disabilities called DisabilityNation  from his home in Arizona. He says, The goal of the site and Podcast is to  promote people with disabilities living life to the fullest and to dispel many  of the stereotypes and beliefs that are widely held by people today.      The show will feature new episodes approximately  every two weeks and will be available via popular channels including the iTunes  Music Store and Podcasts. Interested persons can directly download the Podcast  from <a href="http://www.DisabilityNation.net">http://www.DisabilityNation.net</a> or get the show feed from http://feeds.feedburner.com/disabilitynation.net.</p>
    <p>     A podcast is an audio file in MP3 format  that can be subscribed to and is automatically delivered to your computer. With  podcasts you can choose to listen on your computer or on an audio player such  as the iPod. Often podcasters offer different options in that you can either  stream the file or listen to it from the web site directly or you can download  the show.<br />
      Don't be fooled by the &quot;pod&quot; in  podcast, you don't need an IPod to listen to podcasts. Any MP3 player that you  normally use will play podcasts. Additionally, you can listen on your computer by  using software such as Winamp, Windows Media Player, RealPlayer, and ITunes.<br />
      If you want to listen to or subscribe to  podcasts, the first thing to get is a media aggregator. This is a small piece  of software that downloads any Podcast feeds that you subscribe to. There are  many programs available for subscribing to podcasts.<br />
      After downloading the software just add  the XML file address for the podcast you want to listen to then click the  appropriate button to download the current show. When you want to download new shows,  click the button in your chosen aggregator and the software checks to see if  any new shows have been added and if so, the shows are automatically downloaded  to your computer. Often, the software knows to check for downloads and you  never need to manually tell it to do anything.   For additional information regarding DisabilityNation contact Larry  Wanger at (206) 338-6225 or visit www.DisabilityNation.net.</p>
    <p>                   Chicago Lighthouse Sets Up<br />
      Assistive Technology Computer Help  Desk</p>
    <p>     In an effort to accommodate people with  visual impairments in need of technical support, The Chicago Lighthouse has  established a telephone assistive technology support line.<br />
      The toll free number for the new service  is 888 825-0080. It is available from 8 Am to 4:30 PM Central Time Monday  through Friday.  &quot;We're excited to  have an opportunity to make it easier for people with visual impairments to  take advantage of the many technological advancements that are now more readily  available,&quot; said William Bielawski, program manager for adaptive technology  and office skills training at The Lighthouse.   Bielawski noted that any blind or visually impaired person could call  the support line regardless of what product they're using.  &quot;It can be any hardware or software  relating to assistive technology as long as the customer is visually  impaired,&quot; he said.<br />
      &quot;We also encourage calls from  teachers and other individuals who work with people who are visually impaired  as well as other interested parties.&quot;   Servicing the calls is Ray Campbell, a former engineer with Lucent  Technologies who now works in The Lighthouse's Adaptive Technology program.<br />
      &quot;Our intent is to offer a one stop  place where people who are blind or visually impaired can get the assistance  that they need,&quot; he said.  The  program was made possible when The Lighthouse successfully matched a $41,000  grant from the Boeing Company Foundation.<br />
      Celebrating its centennial this year, The  Lighthouse is one of the oldest social service agencies in Chicago. It is  regarded as the most comprehensive agency of its kind in the Midwest and a model  agency nationally.</p>

    <p>                      Real Time Hotline to 
      Help Air Travelers</p>
    <p>     The Office of the Assistant General  Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings Enforcement Office has  established a toll free number that consumers who experience disability related  air travel problems may use to obtain information and assistance. The phone  number is staffed from 7 am to 11 pm local time in Washington, D.C. seven days  a week. It provides general information to consumers about the rights of air  travelers with disabilities and assists air travelers in resolving time-sensitive  disability-related issues that need to be addressed in real time. If you have  disability-related air service problems the toll-free number for the hotline is  1-800-778-4838 (voice) or 1-800-455-9880 (TTY).</p>
    <p>                        Committee Reports</p>
    <p>                      Legislative Committee<br />
      Donna Rose, Chairperson</p>
    <p>     First let me say that I do not feel I can  adequately cover all of the legislative items that require our attention. I am  just spread too thin and the issues are just too numerous. Please let me know  if you are a good writer and would be interested in writing letters on behalf  of the legislative committee. We cannot simply react to the news. We must all  be proactive. Here is a short list of relevant items that I hope you will find  interesting.      It has been reported by  the American Council of the Blind (ACB) that on Monday, May 1, the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) formally announced their intention to bar,  without exception, Medicare coverage for any device such as closed-circuit television  systems (CCTVs), magnifiers, and any other low vision aids or technologies. CMS  cites that they do not pay for any type of lenses, glasses or otherwise.</p>
    <p>     You may have heard that there is a bill in  Congress to create a Louis Braille coin with the proceeds from the sale of such  coin to be allocated to the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) for Braille  literacy. The House version of this bill (HR 2872) passed by a voice vote. The  Senate version of this bill (S 2321) currently has 64 co-sponsors. While MCBVI  supports Braille literacy, we believe that monies from such a coin could be  used to promote many Braille literacy projects throughout America and shouldn't  be allotted to one organization. Congress men and women are unaware that there  are many agencies working on Braille literacy. Some of our own senators and  representatives have signed on to these bills because they are misinformed as  to the true nature of Braille literacy and which organizations provide it.</p>
    <p>     If you would be interested in receiving  public transit updates from the Let's Get Moving arm of the Michigan Public  Transportation Association you can request to be added to the email list by contacting  Mr. Clark Harder at mpta@tm.net. The Governor finally signed a bill to allow  Grand Rapids and Detroit to get some rapid transit funding. The plan for  Detroit is to provide rapid transit trains from Detroit to Ann Arbor with a  station at Metro Airport. Still our elected officials often fail to understand  that public transit is good for the economy. In other cities where public transportation  has been improved and increased there was a definite increase in the number of  companies which located themselves in those cities, bringing jobs and revenue  to those areas.</p>
    <p>     By now you have probably heard that the  Michigan School for the Blind property has been sold to the Michigan Leadership  Academy and the City of Lansing. According to articles in the Lansing State Journal  the City plans to build 45-55 homes on their portion of the property which will  not include low-income housing. Part of the proceeds from this sale have gone  to the Michigan Trust Fund for Camp T, while the rest will be allocated to the  National Federation of the Blind for the operation of Newsline, the telephone  service that provides listeners with several newspaper options for their listening  pleasure. Once again we regret that our government officials fail to understand  that there are many ways in which blind folks get their news information, such  as radio talking book services and other electronic formats, and that these  need support as well. The bill signed by the Governor allows the Michigan Commission  for the Blind to appropriate the funds for Newsline. We hope that the  Commission will act responsibly always asking for an accounting of how funds  are used for Newsline when ever they are involved in appropriating funds to  this project. It is our belief that doing so will make certain that all  appropriations are used solely for this program as legislated.</p>
    <p>                      Membership committee<br />
      Donna Rose, Co-Chairperson<br />
      John Mc Mahon, Co-Chairperson</p>
    <p>     The past six months have been a busy time  for John Mc Mahon and me as we have had to count members, cash checks and  prepare our membership list. We currently have about 151 members, which is up from  last year at this time. Please be aware that as in the past we will not accept  dues beyond the August 31, 2006 deadline for this year. This is to allow us  time to Braille out the membership list for the nominations committee for the  October elections. As always members can send their membership dues to John Mc  Mahon, Treasurer, 517 S. 13th Street, Escanaba, MI 49829. Please include a  format preference for the MCBVI News and the Braille Forum. We welcome back all  of our returning members and to those who are new we extend a special greeting  of friendship.</p>
    <p>                      Nominations Committee<br />
      By Karla Fields, Chairperson</p>
    <p>     There are three offices open for votes  this fall during our state convention. The offices of president, secretary, and  assistant treasurer will all need to be filled. Deb Wild will run again for  secretary and Kyle Austin has offered to run again as assistant treasurer. To  make a nomination or confirm your own candidacy contact Karla Fields at (586)  465-2338.</p>
    <p>                     Publications committee<br />
      Donna Rose, Chairperson &amp; Editor</p>
    <p>     The Spring/Summer issue of the MCBVI news  will be the only one produced this summer. Our next issue will be published  after the October convention with the next deadline for articles, reports and updates  being October 16th. That issue will be slightly larger as it will contain the  contact information for our executive board members and committee chairpersons.  Please keep this portion of that newsletter as it will only be printed once per  year. Of course, you can always call me if you need the contact information for  any of these people.   Or email me at <a href="mailto:wild-rose@sbcglobal.net">wild-rose@sbcglobal.net</a>. <br />
      Some of you have asked how to submit  documents. I prefer MS Word attachments as they are easier to cut and paste while  maintaining the formatting. Please help me out by spell checking submissions  prior to sending them to me. I get some wild spellings sometimes and if I don't  catch them they don't make a very good impression.  I hope this newsletter has been fun and  informative for you. Happy summer!</p>
    <p>                      Resolutions committee<br />
      By Chris Schumacher</p>
    <p>     Our committee had its first meeting of  this year in April and has gotten off to a good start by writing one resolution,  but we would like to have more. So we need to hear from you. Remember that the  deadline for submissions is September 1st, and that will be here before we know  it. These resolutions give our organization direction in what issues you would  like to have addressed in 2007. They can be sent to me in Braille, on cassette  or computer disk, or typed. If you don't want to try and write one yourself,  send me your ideas, and the committee will put them together in the form of a  resolution. Give us something to work on at our next meeting.</p>
    <p>                 Scholarships &amp; Grants  Committee<br />
      By Rosemarie Facilla,  Chairperson</p>
    <p>     The scholarship Committee is working hard.  thus far we have received three applications and are hoping to receive more  before our June 15 deadline. John McMahon has worked hard on resolving Peterson  scholarship questions so we will know how much money we have to work with  through that scholarship as we have applicants that may be eligible. No one has  applied for a grant at this time. For more information contact Rosemarie  Facilla at 231-759-8734.<br />

      Chapter Updates</p>
    <p>                 Blue Water League of The Blind<br />
      By Jeanette Geno</p>
    <p>     Despite the fact that 5 of our members are  struggling with serious health and cancer issues, we are active and celebrating  the return of warmer weather. Jennie LaPine has cancer of the liver, and BJ  Seaman is back to work following her regimen of Chemo therapy. We enjoyed a  successful accessible Game Night in April, and planned a number of upcoming  activities in our May meeting. The sub-regional library director also attended  our May meeting to enlist our help in forming a reading club. Ten members  signed up, and our first meeting of this interesting group will be held June 22  where we will review and select titles to read and discuss at future book club  meetings. One suggestion we made during the formation of the Star Library Book  Club, was not to make it exclusive to Braille and talking book readers.  Instead, we expressed an interest in integrating these activities with sighted patrons  of our public library system who also will learn and be sensitized to the  active and equal participation by those who read books in alternative ways.  This suggestion was well received, and we look forward to future discussions  about books of mutual interest to participating readers. This might be the door  that opens eyes to the importance of equal integration and access to public  services and resources.<br />
      Also in June we will host a picnic at the  Silver Trails Boy Scout Camp for visually impaired members and friends.  Scouting volunteers will be on hand to assist in the roasting of hot dogs and  marshmallows to go along with a lot of tasty summer treats. We hold no meetings  in July. August we will take a 3 hour cruse on the St. Clair River, or hold our  meeting at Scoops, a 1950s style ice cream and pizza parlor. We plan a  fundraising auction to go along with our meeting in September, where we will  finalize our transportation to the MCBVI convention in October. October will also  find us celebrating the Fall with a Harvest party, and November out to a  restaurant for Thanksgiving. The local area Lions club members usually share a  Fall picnic with our chapter, and host a Christmas party in December. We meet  the third Thursday of most months, at 7 p.m. Visitors and members are most  welcome to join us. For more details, please call chapter President Jeanette  Geno at (810) 982-0717 during day light hours. May each of you be blessed until  our next report._</p>
    <p>                Capitol Area Council of the  Blind<br />
      By Donna Rose</p>
    <p>     The Capitol Area Council of the Blind  helped raise money for transportation to Visions 2006, a vendor fair for people  who are blind or visually impaired which was held in Ann Arbor on May 10th. Those  who attended were from our chapter and the Lansing Area Low Vision Support  Group. A special thanks to the Capitol Area Transportation Authority (CATA) for  their donation of $200, the Apothecary Shop in Lansing for their donation of  $50 and to Wal-Mart in Okemos for a promise of a donation of $600. There were 20  people who attended the vendor fair and they all had a marvelous time.<br />
      Today we had an end of the year picnic at  Grand Haven Manor where Jim and Arlene Moore reside. It was a very nice get  together and the group may consider having their Christmas party there in December.  We have distributed our resource list and will be checking up on whether or not  it helps the community. Mike Geno had a Braille embosser delivered to our  chapter and as soon as we get the Duxbury software we will be on our way to do  some brailling in our community. Our meetings will begin again in September.  For more information about our chapter contact President Jim Moore at 517-374-8681.</p>
    <p>                  Detroit Council of the Blind<br />
      By Regina Wesley</p>
    <p>     The Detroit Council of the Blind continues  to sponsor bingo. We are planning to have a summer bingo sometime in July and  will offer great prizes for players as appreciation for those who regularly  play. On August 19th we will be taking a trip to Pudding Bay which will cost  $50 per person. For more information contact Regina Wesley at (248) 334-8386.</p>
    <p>             Detroit Northwest Council of the  Blind<br />
      by Chris Schumacher</p>
    <p>     Our chapter has been quite busy in the  past couple of months. In March, Kim Walsh, the director of the Detroit Radio  Reading Service, asked to come and speak to us about concerns she has regarding  House Bill 5392--The Accessible Electronic Information Act--and how it could  impact radio reading services in Michigan. As a result, we got together by  teleconference and drafted a letter expressing our feelings regarding this  matter. No action has been taken on this bill yet, but the letter is ready to  be sent if necessary. We represented MCBVI at the Visions 2006 event in Ann Arbor  on May 10th. Also in May we sold  some Avon products as a chapter fund raiser. Our meetings are held the second  Saturday of the month from 12:30 to 3 p.m. at Brownie's Diner in Wayne. Call George  Illingworth at (313) 937-9687 for more information and to make a reservation. _</p>
    <p>      Kalamazoo Council of the Blind and  Visually Impaired<br />
      By Sherry Gordon</p>
    <p>     The KCBVI is 38 members strong! We turned  in our member roster, paid our dues and are ready to go! We did a fund raising project  with Old Country Buffet. Folks got a full tummy and we made a few dollars. We  are currently selling Krispy Kreme donut coupons if interested, the coupons are  $5 each; you may purchase your donuts at anytime--we are giving you that  option! We had our April meeting at the new College of Health and Human  Services Building on Western Michigan University's campus. What a beautiful  building! There is awesome state-of-the-art classroom technology throughout this  building. This building houses the Department of Blindness and Low Vision  Studies where Paul and Sue Ponchillia work. The KCBVI does not meet during July  and August--we will have a picnic. This is always a great occasion--we have  many great cooks in the KCBVI! For more information contact our chapter  secretary, Lisa Kisiel, at (269) 552-4082. Have a great summer!!</p>
    <p>     Muskegon Area Council of the Blind &amp;  Visually Impaired<br />
      By Rosemarie Facilla</p>
    <p>     Muskegon Area Council of the Blind and  Visually Impaired meets the third Saturday of the month at the USA cafe on  Lakeshore Drive in Muskegon. We meet at 12 noon for lunch and our meeting afterward.  Our chapter is working on publicity and will be passing out information on  Saturday June 3 at the Wings of Mercy Pancake Breakfast. We do not meet during  the months of July and August, but we are hoping to plan some summer  activities. in September we hope to be able to have a presentation arranged for  the meeting and take care of business of officers etc. for our November  elections.

    <p>          Visually Impaired Persons for  Progress (VIPP)<br />
      By Deb Wild</p>
    <p>     VIPP met in April and May at the Grand  Villa Restaurant for dinner and our business meeting. Ann Griffioen came to  April's meeting and gave Deb Wild a letter regarding the dissolution of the Kent  County Council. This will be presented at July's MCBVI board meeting. We will  attend a White Caps baseball game in late June as a fundraiser for VIPP.  Included in the ticket price are a hot dog and a drink. Joe Sibley gave a MoPix  presentation to some folks in Muskegon.   Our brochures need to be redone. Work continues on our bylaws. A  nominations committee was formed to compile a slate of officers for next fall.  We need to elect a new president and secretary. Two recreational outings are  being explored: One is a trip to Muskegon to Michigan Adventure which is both  an amusement park and a water park. The other is a trip down the Grand River on  the Grand Lady. We decided to conduct our business meetings in 90 minutes  instead of two hours. This was successfully done in May. Jim Bonnema and his  wife Bonnie were our guests in May. Jim is a faithful volunteer at the Association  for the Blind and Visually Impaired. He told of his trip to South Africa where  he visited many relatives. We were surprised to hear how high the crime rate is  higher than say Chicago. Young ladies carry Derringers in their purses. His  niece showed hers and forestalled a would-be mugging on an escalator. The  poverty rate is high there as well. The relatives were shown pictures of some  huge Michigan snow banks. They in turn were alarmed that we would let our  children out to play in that stuff. It was a very enjoyable talk. Form more  information about the chapter contact Deb Wild at 616-235-8189.</p>

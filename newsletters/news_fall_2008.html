    <p> From Our incoming president<br />
      By Joe Sibley, MCBVI President</p>
    <p> Hello good friends! First, I want to express again how honored and humbled I was when you enthusiastically endorsed me as your new president at convention. As of this writing, I have been president for a whole week! Yes, I am just a little intimidated by the task, I have a lot to learn, but we have great people serving in leadership positions. I am excited to be a part of this great team, and look forward to being of service.<br />
      I would be remiss if I did not pay proper homage to our immediate past president Michael Geno who thankfully remains on the executive board. If I were to list everything Michael does for the blind and VI community both in and separate from this organization, Donna would have a really long newsletter, and we would have to ship the Braille copies by freight. Suffice it to say, Michael's leadership and service have touched countless lives. Plus I have enjoyed  working with him for a number of years now, he's just a great guy, and I am honored to have him as my friend. Many fine individuals preceded Michael in this position as well. <br />
      At the convention this year, I was struck by what a great group of people we have. We are a diverse group from across the state, but the fellowship we enjoy is wonderful. We enjoy the social aspects, but there are many people ready to jump into service when needed.<br />
      When I lost most of my sight, now more than ten years ago, the best thing I ever did was to get involved with VIPP, and later the state organization. More people need to know about MCBVI and how beneficial it is to be of service, and how each individual benefits from being a part of this fine group. We need to expand our public relations efforts giving us more exposure in the media, and to those who council or medically serve those with vision loss. <br />
    </p>
    <p>We need to reach out to the young people. We need to examine why some chapters are growing, and others are struggling. I hope to visit every chapter in the next year. We have a great thing going on here, and we need to offer it to as many people as we can.<br />
      Well, this is getting a little wordy, so I will close by once again thanking everyone who attended the 2008 convention, and the many many hands who helped in any way to make it a success. Group hug!</p>
    <p> From The Past President's Desk<br />
      By Michael Geno</p>
    <p> By the slight change in the title of this column, those who were not at our recently ended 2008 annual convention, are informed of the election of our new President Joe Sibley.  New officers also affirmed were, Donna Rose as our first Assistant Treasurer, and Matthew Livingston I recently appointed to serve the remainder of John McMahon's term as Treasurer.  Mat's professional skills as an Accountant will help us keep our payments, books, and reporting in good order and up-to-date.  While Matt will not be able to attend all Board meetings, Donna will partner closely with him to be sure that checks are written, and vouchers responded to at our face-to-face Board meetings.  I also want to congratulate Deb Wild upon her re-election as Secretary for another two year term.  I will remain active as immediate Past President, and plan to have a little more time to devote toward our Technology Committee.<br />
      Five years ago when Jeanette and I discussed my decision to run for President, we had no idea what additional challenges lay before us.  In 2005 we were told that her brain tumor that had been dormant for so many years began  growing again.  I also was diagnosed with cancer that year requiring surgery, and follow-up treatments.  For the next two years our journey took us through unplanned medical tests and treatments and weeks of travel to and from  Detroit every day.  Now after a second surgery and recent test results, my cancer is not showing signs of activity and Jeanette's tumor has stopped growing.  Both of us are regularly checked for changes, and remain hopeful and very  thankful for these results.  We also deeply appreciate your many kind messages and prayers sent on our behalf. 
      During this time of service and challenge, we witnessed a pulling together of our Leadership Team, and involved members to carry on necessary duties and activities supporting the efforts of MCBVI and my responsibilities as  President.  We couldn't have experienced the success and growth during my two terms as president without you.  The awards I was honored to present at our last convention banquet were well deserved.  I wish we could have  recognized all of you deserving of our appreciation.  I expect that our fine awards program will continue a tradition to highlight at future banquets, more of you who continue to set a fine example of leadership and service to others.<br />
      Preparing my final contribution under this column heading, I am reminded of all we have faced and accomplished in the past years.  There is so much to celebrate, and so much more to be done to brighten the lives and  aspirations of persons who are blind and visually impaired.  Joe Sibley and I will be working closely together to maintain our momentum, and continued growth here in Michigan.  I urge each of you who regularly read this  publication to also support our Leadership Team and hard working committees with your time, financial support, and talents.<br />
      Noah's story in the Bible revealed that nobody in the desert was interested in building boats where there was no water and the sun was shining.  Then when the rains began and the water rose, the sense and need of that very thing became all too clear.  If your life is free from challenges to your freedom or rights to fully participate as a respected citizen, the need to work on protecting those rights and respect may not seem urgent.  We need to remain  aware that there is always a storm of darkness brewing or actually raging somewhere on this planet in the lives of persons who are blind.  We need to get involved, stay active and prepared.  Human nature wakens to this wisdom  every time there is a loss of electric power in a community.  All of a sudden people are interested in finding things they usually don't need or use every day.  Where are the flashlights, batteries, candles or matches?  If it is already  dark when they truly recognize the need for these items, they vow to better prepare the next time it gets light.<br />
      The Michigan Council Of The Blind and Visually Impaired along with our national organization and local chapters are good preparation for the storm.  There is a great need regarding vision loss, to educate the public, advocate in the courts, and demonstrate success and independence on the job or at home.  Don't wait until it rains on your parade to look for an umbrella.  When you or someone you know faces all the related challenges of blindness and the public myths and assumptions involved, the MCBVI is that network of friends and support that can help.  We are your link to the best ideas and resources that can result in hope, and self confidence, and success.  I invite you to take up what skills or tools you have and join us to keep that ark strong and ready to float and shelter through the storms we know will regularly come.  Jeanette and I have recently traveled through some of our own personal storms.  During our dark times, God's grace and the lights from each of your involved caring hearts helped guide our way and gave us hope.  We are truly thankful.</p>
    <p> 35th annual convention wraps up in September<br />
      By Joe Sibley, Convention Committee Chairperson</p>
    <p> Success Without Sight, A Vision for the Future was the theme of the 2008 MCBVI convention held September 25-28 at the Howard Johnson Plaza in Wyoming, on the south side of Grand Rapids. As no chapter hosted the convention this year, a statewide planning committee was formed with Joe Sibley, Linda Brown, Tyrone Hamilton, Michael Geno, Jackie Boomstra, and Mike and Sandy Smith.<br />
      Events this year included a MoPix movie on Thursday, and a large vendor and exhibit display featuring technology from MEE Inc. and many other exhibitors. Friday afternoon activities were open to the public and included well  attended presentations by Michelle Visscher from MCB, and Carlos Gallusser from leader dogs for the blind.  Friday evening new officers were voted in by acclimation including Joe Sibley as the new president, Deb Wild returning as secretary, and Donna Rose the new assistant treasurer. The annual auction with Kyle Austin raised 926 dollars to help with convention expenses. Mike &amp; Sandy Smith then offered Karaoke with lyrics
      available in Braille and large print.<br />
      Saturday featured sessions on transit with Dave Bulkowski and Casey Dutmer, an MCBVI board presentation on your rights and responsibilities if approached by a law officer, technology and more thoughts by Mike Ellis, and voting rights by Tom Masseu. Mike Ellis also donated a Victor Stream and 3 sets of computer speakers to auction off for an additional 342 dollars of income.<br />
      Saturday night's banquet featured an inspiring keynote address from Lowell Miller, a blind pastor now in Ohio, but who served many years at a Hudsonville church. After the banquet Greg Brayton, a nationally known blind musician entertained.<br />
      Sunday morning George Illingworth conducted the annual memorial service, and the business meeting wrapped up activities.<br />
      Many helping hands from VIPP members and other volunteers From the area and statewide pitched in to make this year's convention a success. The decision was made at the business meeting to accept a two year offer from the  Howard Johnson Plaza to host the convention based on modest costs and outstanding hospitality this year, and in years past. The 2009 convention is tentatively scheduled for the second weekend in October.</p>

    <p> Mike's Victor Reader Stream Review<br />
      In August ACB Forum<br />
      By Donna Rose</p>
    <p> Did you notice that Mike Geno had a great review on the Victor Reader Stream printed in the Braille Forum in August 2008?  If you missed it you can read it by going to the ACB web site, www.acb.org.  His review discusses the  functions, uses and improvements which could be made to this device in the future.  It is an excellent overview. <br />
      I just purchased mine from Mike Ellis who provided it with an 8gb SD card and a very nice leather holder with a strap for $375.  I wear the device around my neck for easily listening while out and about.  It has completely  improved the amount of reading I do, and makes waiting for rides and doctor appointments a lot more enjoyable.<br />

    <p> VIPP Co-Hosts Community CruiseFest<br />
      By Joe Sibley, MCBVI President</p>
    <p> Visually Impaired Persons for Progress (VIPP) teamed up with Bridge The Gap Ministries, another non-profit organization in an ambitious new project in August. Community CruiseFest was a new two day event that coincided with  the fourth annual 28th Street Metro Cruise which draws about 12,000 classic and custom cars and about 200,000 people to 15 miles of 28th street through five cities. Community CruiseFest was held in the parking lot of Studio 28, a  20 screen theatre in Wyoming. There were food vendors, live entertainment, activities for kids, and a road rally with great prizes. The event was designed to be both a fund raiser, and a community outreach for VIPP and Bridge The  Gap which is working to open a center for teens that will include activities, counseling and much more.  
      Although attendance numbers were a little below projections, the first year event was considered a success. &quot;It was a great event&quot; said Lisa Weber, VIPP president. &quot;The hundreds of people that came through had nothing but  good things to say&quot;. There were some minor behind the scenes issues, including electrical problems, and a pouring rain Friday morning during setup, and Saturday evening. A number of people visited the VIPP booth, inquiring about blindness issues. &quot;We have a list of things to improve on for next year&quot; said Weber&quot; and we have more time on our side. We built a solid foundation for next year&quot;.<br />
      Stage entertainment included a variety of music, jazz, rock, Christian, and hip hop. Nationally known gospel hip hop artist George Moss closed out the entertainment Saturday night after the rain let up to an enthusiastic crowd.<br />
      Other sponsors for CruiseFest included Studio 28, Meijer, and Backyard Grillmasters BBQ.</p>
    <p> Community Cruise Fest<br />
      A Volunteer's Point of View<br />
      By Deb Wild, MCBVI Secretary</p>
    <p> Several of us from Visually Impaired Persons for Progress (VIPP and Bridge the Gap Ministries and other organizations served as volunteers at this major event on Friday and Saturday, August 22 and 23. An incredible amount of work was done by the leaders of this undertaking and sighted volunteers who helped in any way they could, from helping us get around, setting up and taking down things, moving tables, on and on it goes. Many folks worked both Friday and Saturday.<br />
      There were several pit stops along the road rally site where we sat with a sighted partner. At my first sitting we had a rally group of three ladies and another group of two ladies. At each stop the rally participants answered a question or completed a task as part of their challenge or puzzle. Each individual received a small gift and one color sticker for a correct answer or another color for incorrect answers. Their stickers had to be signed or initialed to verify their participation.  At our stop they had to figure out what our Braille message said.  &quot;Community Cruise Fest.&quot;  The words of course were not printed on the Braille message, but there was a printed and brailed alphabet from  which they could study and compare letters.  They would then move on in their cars to the next stop. At my second location we had no rally visitors.</p>
    <p> The paratransit driver with whom I rode Saturday morning said he and his sons on Friday saw the Batmobile in mint condition!  We were facing 28th Street, so old cars, like Corvettes, muscle cars, one old car with an aruga type  horn, lots of motorcycles, and all kinds of traffic was going by.  One lady said she saw a Rolls Royce.  We all wished we could see those classic cars and trucks as they passed!  Our small road rally was part of another major event going on where old and classic cars were riding up and down an approximately 15 mile stretch of 28 Street.  Expressways were a mess too with all the backed-up traffic and work being done on the lanes. Paratransit drivers had their hands full  getting to us!  Kudos to Ken Weber who shuttled us to our various stops.<br />
      Back at our headquarters there was always music playing, thanks to bands that performed and material Joe Sibley and his partner put together, along with food vendors.  I almost chickened out, but I am glad I had a change of heart thanks to a long talk with Lisa Weber.  There was a great sense of excitement and fun in 
      the air. </p>

    <p> Better Education for Blind<br />
      and Visually Impaired Children</p>
    <p> Submitted by Commissioner Geri Taeckens, MCB board liaison to the education coalition <br />
      The quality of education for many of Michigan's blind and visually impaired children has been a concern of parents, students, educators, and blind and visually impaired adults.  On 9-19-08, the Michigan Commission for the Blind  held a panel discussion on this very topic during the afternoon session of the quarterly board meeting.  This panel consisted of two parents of blind children, Gwen Botting, President of Michigan Parents of Children with Visual  Impairments, Lydia Schuck, Quest for Success coordinator for Camp TUHSMEHETA, Shaun Williams, blind student and participant of MCB Summer program, Maria Peak, Eaton County ISD Transition Coordinator, Shawnese  Laury-Johnson, MCB Rehab Counselor for transitioning blind youth, and Leamon Jones, MCB Director of Consumer Services. <br />
      Areas discussed:  What is going well in terms of education for our blind children?  What are the existing needs?  What are potential solutions?<br />
      Many wonderful experiences and ideas were shared by panel members and participants from the audience.  The goal to develop a coalition to address the needs of educating blind and visually impaired children was established.  Pat Cannon, director of the Michigan Commission for the Blind offered the agencies support in this effort.<br />
      The results of this meeting were shared with over two hundred participants in the annual MCPVI retreat on 9-26-08.  Collette Bauman, director of Michigan Low Incidence Outreach program, her colleague Pat Love, and Elizabeth  Bauer from the Michigan Dept. of Ed, are also in support of this endeavor. <br />
      Further information on how individuals can become involved will be announced in the near future.  You can check the MCB web site, join the list serve, or contact Commissioner Geri Taeckens, MCB board liaison to the education coalition at, geri.taeckens@isahealthfund.org or call her at (906) 632-4565.</p>

    <p> My Opinion:  Social Security<br />
      Debit Card Not A Sound Investment<br />
      By Donna Rose, Editor</p>
    <p> You may have learned that Social Security has contracted with a private company to offer a debit Master Card as an option for you to receive Social Security or Supplemental Security Income Benefits.  I foresee some problems  with these cards, particularly with fees which will be attached to them.  Once a month your debit card would be recharged with your benefit funds for you to use as 
      you wish.  The card would have the Master Card logo on it.   I would strongly recommend instead that individuals use direct deposit for their benefit checks from Social Security.  Even though you do not have to have a bank account  to use one of these cards, a bank or credit union will offer you more services for free with your checking account.  For example, if you want to pay a bill using your loaded benefit debit card you will pay .50 for each one.  A credit  union will offer this bill pay service for free, either on the website or via phone,  and many of their websites are accessible to screen readers so you can bank and pay bills independently.  Although this debit card is advertised as free  to use, there are actually limits on how many withdrawals and other transactions you can make before being charged each month.  I can only imagine what could happen if this card gets lost or stolen.  And for people on lower  incomes, will they be able to keep close enough track on their remaining funds so as not to run out of money too early in the month?  Many checking accounts will offer you interest on even smaller balances, so for my money I  believe direct deposit is a much better investment.  If you are trying to establish good credit a relationship with a bank or credit union is essential.  
      Just a note, I have discovered you get a lot more services and much lower fees at a credit union and your deposits are insured as with other financial institutions, currently up to $100,000 per account.  And either a bank or a  credit union will offer you the option of receiving a debit card attached to your checking account with most of these protected in case of fraudulent use.</p>
    <p> Alert To All Concerned Citizens,<br />
      by Michael Geno</p>
    <p> &quot;We are Appalled at the depiction of blindness in this film!&quot;  The movie &quot;Blindness&quot; just released is a serious attack on the dignity of humanity.  It gashes at the respectability of people who experience vision loss.  The disgusting  portrayal in this film of the average person after loosing sight is worse than insulting because it vividly suggests negative myths and helpless depravity whenever vision is absent.  It suggests that blindness is contagious, reducing  those who are blind to depraved selfish abusive animals without morals or concern for others. 
      Those who may have little experience or knowledge about living with vision loss, may assume the propaganda about blindness in this movie to be believable.  The circumstances in the plot tug at more than the imagination.  The  sick producers of this film are promoting fear and misconception often assumed by the sighted who close their eyes and speculate what it might be like if blindness occurred.  Without the knowledge and reality of adjustment and  training, viewers who even buy into a small part of this film's scenario, may project that nastiness onto people they meet who are blind.<br />
      In the play &quot;The Miracle Worker,&quot; Helen Keller is more than  blind and deaf.  At first she is a small child uncivilized, and isolated.  Her behavior and skills improve with training and understanding.  By contrast the adults depicted in  the movie &quot;Blindness&quot; seem to lose so much more than their sight.  The premise in this film is that vision is the only thing that separates civilized adults from behaving like depraved selfish animals.<br />
      I would be outraged even if I were not blind.  This film is more than an imaginative lie.  It is brutally abusive toward human kind in general.  Disguised as entertainment, producers of this film called &quot;Blindness&quot; slash mercilessly  at the common character of mankind, and rape the spirit of humanity.  While blindness is used as a triggering threat, the nauseating idea behind this misleading film defecates on the common sense and dignity of all humanity.<br />
      Respond to the twisted ingrates who gambled on such trash making them money with the outrage they deserve.  Do more than avoid the stench of this film.  Contact all involved in the entertainment business and challenge the distribution and showing of this terrible movie.  Call the ACB national office at 800 424-8666 for more information.  Then contact your local churches, government leaders, and neighbors who need to know about the ugly worm this film crawls on.  Snuff flicks are pornographic depictions of the abusive murder of children.  This film knocks at that same door, and our failure to react now to the filth that it is, will only open this door to worse.<br />
      Editor's Note:  In its first weekend out in theaters the movie Blindness was a huge flop, coming in last for box office sales.  ACB and NFB are commended for their quick action to educate the public through press releases and  theater gatherings to hand out educational information to patrons attending the film.</p>
    <p> Braille Challenge 2009<br />
      By Charis Austin</p>
    <p> Please consider being a sponsor of the Michigan Regional Braille Challenge, a program of the Braille Institute.  When we support literacy we seldom think Braille, yet for thousands Braille is the path to literacy. Your support will benefit Braille students, grades 1 through 12, in an exciting day long event. The students will compete in reading speed, spelling, comprehension, proof reading, grammar, charts &amp; graphs and more. <br />
      On Saturday, February 14, 2009 the Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired will host the Michigan Regional Braille Challenge in Grand Rapids. The Braille Challenge is a two-stage academic competition designed to  motivate school-age Braille readers to excel in this vital medium. Everyone can compete in this regional challenge with the top students eligible to attend the National Competition in Los Angeles in June.  
      Our aim is to build their enthusiasm through this family oriented event as this competition can be a great motivator for all Braille-reading students. 
      As a sponsor your company/organization will be listed in the program and in any advertising, announced at meal time, and shared at the closing awards ceremony. Sponsors over $999 will also be listed in all advertising for the  event. The budget for this event is just over $4,500 plus awards and prizes. We are looking for sponsors to insure a quality event with fun and class. Can we count on you??We will require many volunteers to make the day go  smoothly. Perhaps some of your associates would be willing to spend a Saturday being amazed by Michigan's children who are visually impaired.<br />
      To be a sponsor or to volunteer you are invited to e-mail Charis Austin at caaustin@abvimichigan.org or call her at 616-458-1187 or 800-466-8084 Ext. 328. You will be contacted for your level of sponsorship, volunteer names,  or answers to any questions you may have.</p>
    <p> Committee Reports</p>
    <p> Membership by Donna Rose<br />
      Outgoing Chairperson</p>
    <p> In 2008 we had 161 members enjoying the benefits of MCBVI.  We passed out membership pins at our 2007 convention and chapters are encouraged to request pins as needed for new members who have not received them.<br />
      Charis Austin will be our new membership chairperson.  You will send your 2009 dues to Matt Livingston, our newly appointed state treasurer.  His address is: </p>
    <p>All Needs Accounting<br />
      Matt Livingston<br />
      7751 Lakeshore Road<br />
      Lakeport, MI  48059</p>
    <p> It will be helpful to put a note inside the envelope stating the name of your chapter with your dues list and that your dues are for MCBVI.  Charis will be handling membership for 2009, so you will need to get your dues into Matt  no later than Feb 15, so she will have time to prepare the list for ACB. 
      It might be helpful to Charis as well to use your membership list from last year and use the following codes before each name to indicate changes.</p>
    <p>*COA = Change of Address, email or phone<br />
      *DEL = Delete this member<br />
      *Dec - Deceased Member<br />
      *CF = Change Format<br />
      *NEW = New Member</p>
    <p> It has been a pleasure working on this important job for the past four years, but as you all know I am a bit burned out on it and glad to pass it on to someone else.  Contact Charis if you would like to help with this committee. <br />
    </p>
    <p>Her phone number is:  616-532-4737.  Eventually she will probably be assigned a toll free number.  An updated contact list of the leadership team will be provided in a future issue.</p>
    <p> Publication Committee<br />
      By Donna Rose, Chairperson</p>
    <p> New members will start receiving their newsletters in 2009.  Please make sure you offer the email option to all members when they renew their membership.  The email version is extremely cost effective.  We will still offer Braille, large print and audio cassettes as well.  The Braille Forum is no longer available in disk format, but can now be received via email.<br />
      The deadline for the winter newsletter will be January 31, 2009.  Please send all reports and chapter updates to me by that time with contact info.  If you have a person in your chapter who deserves special recognition please  submit a short article about them.  One will be chosen each issue for publication. </p>
    <p> Public Relations<br />
      Donna Rose, Chairperson</p>
    <p> A press release went out to twenty four Michigan newspapers and a few radio stations prior to our convention.  In early October I distributed an ACB press release to these same sources regarding the movie, `Blindness'. <br />
      In the upcoming year we will work diligently to bring information to the public about MCBVI and our local chapters.  Joe is planning to visit each chapter and hopefully we can work to re-establish those in places where they have  disbanded.  We will also increase our contact with the Michigan Parents of the Visually Impaired.  If you would like to be a part of this effort please contact me at 517-333-9117.</p>
    <p> Chapter Updates<br />
      Blue Water League Of The Blind<br />
      Port Huron Michigan<br />
      By Jeanette Geno President</p>
    <p> Hello from the BWL!  In July the Blue Water League shared a summer pizza and ice cream social with visitors and new members.  In August we held a pool party at one of our member's homes.  Because they had to take down  their pool early, we kept cool with iced drinks and great picnic food.  More fun and fellowship was enjoyed by all at another picnic shared with a local area Lions club in September.<br />
      We also sent ten of our members in September to the MCBVI convention in Wyoming Michigan this year.  All reported having a good time.   I couldn't attend the convention this year with them, but, I wanted to thank all involved with presenting a plaque to Michael at the conclusion of his second term as president. I know that he always puts his heart into everything he does for the MCBVI, and will continue to do so. All in the BWL express our Thanks and  send our best wishes to incoming president Joe Sibley, and new assistant Treasurer Donna Rose.<br />
      October finds us busy with a meeting of our Book Talkers Club, 
      followed the next week by our annual Harvest Party. In November we will celebrate Thanksgiving with our Canadian friends with a traditional catered dinner.  wrapping up the Christmas season in December we look forward to  sharing our annual Christmas party with our Lions friends.  Until my next report, we in the BWL wish each of you a blessed Fall and Holiday season.</p>
    <p> Capital Area Council<br />
      By Donna Rose, President</p>
    <p> Our chapter had two game nights earlier in the summer where we shared a meal and had tables with members playing Skipbo, Black Jack and Hearts.  We have been meeting in the back area of a quaint little restaurant called the  Gone Wired Caf‚ in Lansing.  The owner, Colleen, has been very generous and helpful.  Her business is centrally located for all of us and is on a major bus line which many of our members use.<br />
      Six members from Lansing attended the September state convention and we all had a blast.  We would like to raise more funds to sponsor other members who are low income for next year.  At the convention we sold $150 in  knives and soup mixes.  We still have more, so contact me if you want to purchase them for $6 a piece.  They make great gifts.  We have baked potato soup mix and cheddar broccoli soup which require adding four cups of water and  bringing them to a boil.  We also have a black bean chili which requires adding a pound of ground beef and a couple of other ingredients.  And we are still selling the paring knives which come in storable plastic containers and which  are extremely sharp.<br />
      Our upcoming plans include our Christmas party on December 2nd, a Michigan Princess cruise in the spring, game nights, possible bingo party and a summer 2009 picnic.</p>
    <p> Detroit Northwest Chapter<br />
      By Chris Schumacher, President</p>
    <p> Due to scheduling and transportation issues, all of our summer meetings were conference calls.  The main focus of those meetings was our trip to Grand Rapids for the MCBVI convention.  Nine members of our chapter attended,  and a good time was had by all.  We would especially like to thank the Royal Oak Lions Club for their generous donation that enabled us to use a van from the Salvation Army.  Also, a big thank you goes out to our chapter members  Mike and Sandy Smith for all their hard work in providing the musical entertainment for the convention, Mike for the music and Sandy for brailing all the words to those karaoke songs.  At our next meeting we will be discussing  future plans for our chapter, election of officers, etc.  Have a wonderful holiday season!</p>
    <p> Kalamazoo Council of the Blind<br />
      By Sherry Gordon</p>
    <p> The KCBVI had our annual picnic just a bit late this year. We actually had a picnic at Lisa Kisiel's home for our September meeting. All 15 in attendance had a lot of great food to eat and enjoyed great camaraderie!!<br />
      On October 19, we will be going to VerHague's Orchard for our annual supply of apples, cider and donuts. That is always a great trip and very pleasing to the palate!! We will also pick up some Halloween table decorations like  pumpkins, gourds, etc.<br />
      In November, we will hold our annual membership meeting, followed in December with our annual Christmas party.  At this time we do not yet have a date for our Christmas 
      party.<br />

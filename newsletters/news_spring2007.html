    <p>                    From The President's Desk<br />
      By Michael Geno</p>
    <p>     This article will help you have a better  understanding of a dispute among the blind over currency.  I also have included a parable that you might  use to help family, friends, and government or media representatives to  separate reality from myth.  Informed persons  will be motivated to protect an opportunity for the blind to enjoy  independence, dignity, and equal participation in a basic required activity of  society.  That requirement being, the independent  identification and personal management of our national currency.</p>
    <p>     But there is this confusing twist for  government leaders and the general public to try and figure out.  This pending improvement is now being  attacked.  For the uninitiated, it may  come as a surprise to learn that this opposition is being argued by brothers and  sisters in the minority of the blind.   These few seek to kill the projects of others they do not control.  Why do they fear or resist reasonable  improvements enabling every citizen to successfully identify all U.S. currency  by touch as well as sight?<br />
      There is more revealed in this struggle  than just a disagreement between organizations of the blind.  Try to avoid assuming that competing opinions  just represent differences in philosophy. Contrasting statements reported here,  shed light in dark shadows of manipulation and control.  I hope what I have reported here, will help  you to see and understand the problems we all will suffer as a result of the  National Federation Of The Blind agenda.<br />
      Even members in the NFB have communicated to  me that they also disapprove of, and question the outrageous claims made by their  officers.  Other visually challenged  citizens who belong to no organization at all, also express their view that no  single group can represent them with one voice.<br />
      I hope many grasp what my concluding story  reveals.  Then reread and consider these  facts, and ask yourself, why would anyone try to convince you that  &quot;Accessible Currency is dangerous?&quot;</p>
    <p>     A precedent setting decision was reached  by a Federal court ruling last November 28, 2006, that the United States  Department of the Treasury is in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation  Act by not designing its paper currency in an accessible form.  If upheld, this decision will bring  independence for those who have some vision loss.  The ruling by Federal District Judge James  Robertson points out, that U.S. banknotes of  identical size and texture, deny blind people independent access to paper  currency.<br />
      The efforts of the American Council Of The  Blind, supported by their 70 affiliates comprised of tens of thousands of  members throughout the 50 states, successfully argued for this favorable ruling.<br />
      Other organizations of the blind including  OurMoneyToo, an independent group of blind and sighted volunteers also consider  this decision as welcome news.  In 2004  they formed their organization to support equally accessible paper currency,  focusing their efforts on educating the public about the benefits to all.<br />
      Not every one is celebrating.      One outspoken organization 
      claiming  to be the voice of the nations blind continues to argue against progress toward  accessible currency for all.  Their president  has been very outspoken with the weakest arguments I have ever heard from the  National Federation Of The Blind.   Perhaps he hopes to strike a nerve, when declaring excessive cost as a  serious drawback to any currency design improvements.  But cost has not proven to be a prohibitive  factor for the more than 100 countries that already make use of tactile  differences between their paper bills.  These countries have already invented  efficient ways to deal with retooling ATMs and other vending or money handling machines.<br />
      Sighted as well as blind or visually  impaired persons consider adding tactile features to our currency, a definite  improvement, adding more protection for all.   A software engineer in Waltham, Mass. stated in a news report that,  &quot;Even as a sighted person, I think accessible paper money is a good idea.  For one thing, adding tactile features would make our currency harder to  counterfeit.&quot;      Government  leaders can take this opportunity to create tactile markings using technology  that is difficult for counterfeiters to reproduce.  Judge Robertson noted in his opinion that,  the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank consider the tactile features  on euros and Swiss banknotes, an additional security feature.  This is because they can be so hard to  replicate.&quot;<br />
      There are more arguments for and against,  that space does not permit me to include here.   But the public needs to be made aware of NFB false claims and  confusion.  Their publicity misleads the public.  Does NFB spend tax dolors and donations they  have collected to help the blind, on contrary press releases?  Their headlines cry, &quot;United States  Currency Does Not Discriminate Against Blind People!&quot;  What an astonishing claim for them to make.  Donors to the NFB should demand their  non-identifiable currency back.  This  Federation plans to support the Treasury in an appeal process.  More is revealed in statements made to the  press by the NFB president Marc Maurer.   He publicly argues that this ruling was &quot;dangerous and wrong.&quot;  He also declares that &quot;The blind are not barred from using U.S. paper  money because of the way it is designed.&quot;   He goes on to say, &quot;This ruling misinterpreted the meaning of  discrimination.&quot;<br />
      Notice his misleading substitution of the  word barred for the discrimination problem the court clearly identified.  You can see why it is necessary to include  some of this smoke and mirror rhetoric here to contrast with the other side of  the coin, the public is left to toss.<br />
      What follows is fiction, but perhaps an  illuminating parable.  Yes, it is a story  I tell to entertain, but can easily be applied to the reality blind persons  face everyday when required to handle its inaccessible paper money.</p>
    <p>                       Two Sides Of A Coin<br />
      By Michael Geno,<br />
      MCBVI President</p>
    <p>     Two subjects came before their king to  settle a dispute over money.  Each was  from distant cities of the kingdom having different forms of paper  currency.  The king noted that both men were  without sight as they approached his throne.    Each man held paper notes in one hand and tapped with a cane in the  other.<br />
      What is your claim he asked the man on his  left?  That man replied, I am a  Federationist who has been cheated by this Councilman.  In our transaction he owed me 10  dollars.  This Councilman said he had no  change and gave me what he identified as one 50 dollar bill.  I returned to this Councilman four identical 10  dollar bills. This dishonest Councilman did not want to accept my identical  notes, and asked for different shaped 10 dollar bills similar to those from his  country.  He would not trust that the four  identical Federation bills I gave him were worth 40 dollars as I claimed.<br />
      This Councilman next said that I had the  advantage since it was easy for us both to identify the distinct 50 dollar note  he first paid me.  This Councilman claimed  that he could return my four bills and get 40 single dollar bills in  change.  Not having that many bills, I  refused, and said I would return a fifty dollar bill to this Councilman.  he then gave me back my 4 bills, in exchange  for the one single 50 dollar bill he now holds.   I did not trust that this Councilman would give me back my same four 10 dollar  bills, and gave him one Federation 50 dollar bill.  This Councilman refused to accept this bill,  and asked for his original back.  We  argued and I did not return any bills or the object this Councilman has  attempted to cheat me out of.<br />
      The king then turn to the Councilman on  his right, and demanded of the Councilman, what have you to say to this charge?<br />
      The Councilman held up the bill the  Federationist had given him back and replied.   I have asked to come before you who can see our bills, and decide for  yourself who is being cheated.  There is nothing  more for me to say, because by the witness of the bills in our hands, the truth  is revealed.<br />
      The king knew that bills of different  amounts produced in the Federationist village were all the same size, and not distinguishable  by touch.  He could easily see that the  bill the Councilman held, was only worth 5 dollars.  He said, the single bill you hold is not a 50  dollar bill.  Councilman, the king asked,  do you have other bills in your pocket?   No the man on his right replied.   The king turned to his left and asked to see each of the bills held in  the Federationist's hand.  These were, 4  one dollar bills which did not differ in size and shape from other paper notes traded  in the Federationist's land.<br />
      The king then asked, Federationist, do you  have other bills in your purse?  Yes, the  man replied.  The king said, then get  them out, because you still owe this Councilman money.  And, since you seem to be an expert in  handling and knowing what bills you have, no one may assist you in selecting  which to repay with.  The federationist  became very upset, and nervously fumbled for his purse.  As he pulled it out, he accidently dropped  it, scattering his neatly folded bills on the ground.  Stooping to pick them up, he angrily realized  that they now were not as he had organized them, and guessed at identifying as  many 1 dollar bills as he could.  The  single bill he was sure of, was the distinctly tactile shaped 50 dollar note  the Councilman had originally paid him.   The federationist quickly tucked this 50 dollar bill away in his pocket and  gathered up the rest of the remaining bills at his feet.  But he only could be sure of perhaps 20 of  them.  The Federationist calculated that  he still needed to sort out 25 more dollars of the 45 the king must require him  to repay.<br />
      The Federationist tried to hide that he  was only guessing the denomination of each identical bill he sorted from others  on the ground.  He hoped that they  totaled 45 dollars.  The Federationist  next presented them to the king.<br />
      The king then asked this Federationist if  he still needed more notes to pay the debt?   The Federationist thought about the king's question, and wondered if one  among the three 5 dollar bills he assumed he had put with the other twenty  identical 1 dollar notes in his hand, must have been a 1 dollar bill also.  He exchanged it with another bill from those  he had put back in his purse and handed the Councilman these 23 identical paper  bills he hoped totaled 45 dollars.   There, he cried, I have paid you back!<br />
      The king asked the Councilman if he  accepted the identical bills the Federationist had selected as payment?  The Councilman asked if the bills presented  could be identified by sight?<br />
      Yes, the King replied.  He then decreed that the transaction was  final and the object of interest was not sold.   This king then explained that because the Federationist was at a  disadvantage when selecting the money from his own land, so also is the  Councilman in their verification.  So the  Councilman was forced to suffer the same disadvantage and endure the consequences  of required trust instead of independent determination.  He then noted that both men enjoyed a  personal advantage because of the identifiable bills traded in the Councilman's  land.  He ruled that all bills traded in his  kingdom must be made different enough to be identified by touch.<br />
      After the Councilman accepted the 23 bills  selected by the Federationist, there came a final revelation from the  King.  Now that you have both gambled on  the poor judgment of this Federationist, and his countrymen, I now will reveal  to you the extent of the cost.  Both men  stiffened while the king spoke.    <br />
      The 23 bills this Federationist selected  for you Councilman, each feeling the same, he has repaid you the  following.  Three 20 dollar bills, 6 5  dollar bills, and 19 one dollar bills.   Since it was his own folly to pay the debt with bills that feel the  same, it is fair that he keep the object he first tried to sell.  The Councilman asked that he might see the  coin the Federationist was selling.  The  king then asked to see one.  The  federationist shamefully handed over one gambling coin.  The king laughed at what he saw.  Such a coin is worthless he said.  This coin is never used or trusted in this  city.  The king then gave this coin to  the Councilman to feel.  The Councilman  smiled when he noted by touch
      that  it had no head, only tails.</p>
    <p>             In Memoriam:  Michigan Loses A Treasure<br />
      By Donna Rose</p>
    <p>While  working on our state's membership list today I reflected on the people  represented by each name.  Many of them  hold a special place in my heart.  We are  losing a lot of older members.  These are  the people who we can personally thank for Social Security programs that raised  much of our population out of poverty, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Braille  literacy legislation and so much more in the way of social justice.  These are the people who worked at jobs  before disability civil rights were even conceived.</p>
    <p>Sadly,  on April 25th Michigan lost one of these valued senior members, Sue  Illingworth.  At 83 she was still going  strong working on behalf of all of us and doing it so seamlessly.  We just spoke to her at our quarterly board  meeting four days prior to her death and she attended a committee meeting for  our resolutions committee the night she passed away.  Sue had a heart attack.  It was a shock to everyone.    </p>
    <p>I  can't remember a time when I didn't know the Illingworth's as they have been a  consistent fixture in the history of our state since before I was even  born.  A graduate of Ohio State with a degree  in education, Sue spent her career as a home teacher in Ohio and for the State  of Michigan as a rehabilitation teacher for the blind.  Sue herself was dealing with the eye disease  Retinitis Pigmentosa, and she ultimately lost all of her sight.  But that wouldn't stop Sue, who remained  active after retirement with the Lion's Club and the Michigan Council of the  Blind and Visually Impaired.  Once when I  was in my 20's she said to me how irritating it was to her that many people  didn't think that a blind person could be employed and afford to pay for  things.  She was proud of her work as we  all should be, and she had no trouble speaking her mind to set people straight  when they just didn't get it.  Sue was always  a true champion for our community.</p>
    <p>Sue  was a personality of so much more worth than my words can express here.  She and her husband George were the best set  of inseparable soul mates I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.  They routinely finished each others sentences  and it was obvious how important one was to the other.  There is a tale at a Halloween party sometime  in the past Sue dressed in slacks and went with a t-shirt that read  &quot;Hershey's&quot; and George was dressed the same, but his shirt read  &quot;Hershey's With Nuts&quot;.  Sue  could be so whimsical!  And like most  seniors she had a lot of stories and history to share.</p>
    <p>Sue  is survived by her husband of 48 years, George.   The hearts and minds of all those who are blind and have known the  Illingworth's will be with him as he grieves and attempts to adjust to life without  his best friend.  It is suggested that  those who wish to further honor the memory of Mrs. Suzanne &quot;Sue&quot;  Illingworth may do so by making a contribution to: Lions Club-Plymouth Chapter  or Wayne County Regional Library For the Blind, 30555 Michigan Avenue Westland,  MI 48186.&quot;  There  is now a void that can never be filled by another.  We miss you Sue!</p>
    <p>                          Did You Know?</p>
    <p>     Mid Michigan now has a new &quot;211&quot;  system that can be dialed from a landline phone to gather information on  community help that is available.   Examples of possible referrals include rent and utility assistance, food  assistance, support groups, counseling, substance abuse services, parenting  information, housing, clothing, health needs and counseling.  Other communities are also launching this  &quot;211&quot; service.</p>
    <p>     ACB Diabetics in Action is a relatively  new affiliate of the American Council of the Blind.  To join or find out more information contact  president, Dee Clayton at 515-848-5007. They also have an online chat list  which you can join by sending a blank e-mail to  acbda-subscribe@acb.org.</p>
    <p>     If you are having problems with the  Internal Revenue Service which can't be solved through regular channels, there  is a Taxpayer Advocate Service available.   Although they are technically a part of the IRS, they work  independently.  You can reach their  Detroit office at (313) 628-3670.</p>
    <p>     There is now a new hand held talking menu  available to restaurants.  It is easy to  operate and can be accessed anywhere in an eatery.  It even has a paging feature to alert your  server that you are ready to order.  For  more information visit their web site at: www.menusthattalk.com   </p>
    <p>As  the 2008 launch date for digital talking books and players nears, the National  Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS), Library of  Congress, is preparing its library network for the transition. As part of this  effort, the Digital Transition Advisory Committee met on January 30-31 to  discuss recent implementation developments. NLS established the group, which  succeeds the Digital Long-Term Planning Group, to inform staff about transition  progress and distribution plan updates.  With  the completion of the first Digital Transition Advisory Committee meeting, NLS  is well equipped to move forward with two distribution-related projects. During  the upcoming pre-launch test, patrons selected by eight regional libraries will  test current prototypes of the digital talking books and players. NLS will also  examine digital copy allotment of older book titles in a separate project. More  than 23 million copies of recorded and braille books and magazines were  circulated to a readership of 799,718 in 2004. The International Union Catalog  provides access to 423,500 titles (19 million copies). Audio book readers  borrow an average of 31 books and magazines a year. Braille readers average 20  books and magazines a year. An overview of the NLS digital talking-book project  may be found in Current Strategic Business Plan for the Implementation of  Digital Systems at www.loc.gov/nls/businessplan2006.html</p>
    <p>     ACB is now offering a new ACB tuner for  use with Windows 2000, XP, 2003, and Vista.   Those using Windows 95, 98 or ME, or NT 4.0 can continue using the older  edition of the tuner.  It has many enhanced  features to help you connect easily to ACB Radio.  You can download it at: http://www.acbradio.org/tuner</p>
    <p>                   New Transportation Options</p>
    <p>     By fall it is expected that a new  intercounty railroad will be up and running from Washtenaw to Livingston  County.  The new rail line will be run by  Great Lakes Central Railroad and is a combined business and government  project.  There are high expectations  that it will eventually run from Monroe to Traverse City and Petosky.<br />
      For extremely inexpensive fares, check out  the new Megabus offered by Coach USA, the domestic subsidiary of Scotland-base Stagecoach  Group PLC.  For Internet-savvy travelers  on a budget, Megabus.com claims to offer a service that makes mainstream bus travel  seem pricey: rides from Pittsburgh to Chicago for as little as $1.<br />
      The Chicago-based company, which began  operating in a number of Midwestern cities last year, plans to launch new  service April 2 in Pittsburgh; Ann Arbor; Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Mo.; and  Louisville, Ky. It already offers service between Chicago and Cincinnati,  Cleveland, Detroit, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, St. Louis and  Toledo.  Megabus uses online ticketing and  sidewalk stops instead of ticket counters and bus terminals. Passengers do not  buy tickets, but instead give drivers reservation numbers they receive when  booking online.  The low-cost model was imported  from the United Kingdom, where Stagecoach introduced a similar service nearly  four years ago.

    <p>                       Call For Candidates<br />
      By Donna Rose</p>
    <p>     It is with great sadness that I must  announce that I will not be seeking another term as first vice president of  MCBVI.  I would like to dedicate the next  couple of years to our local chapter.  I am  hoping to remain public relations and publications chairperson and feel that I  will be able to do these jobs better if I limit some of my  responsibilities.  <br />
      As you may know, I was recently promoted  to team leader of the Creative Recovery program at my local Community Mental  Health office.  I am a social worker in  charge of working with three other staff members who plan creative expression  opportunities for those who have severe and persistent mental illnesses.  It is a great job, but sometimes stressful  and challenging.  Like many of you my career  is very important to me, and I get a great deal of satisfaction from  working.  Of course, the paycheck isn't  bad either!  I am at a place in my life  where I need to concentrate mostly on my paid position.<br />
      I would like to take this time to thank  our fabulous board for their enthusiastic support and steadfast  participation.  Special thanks go out to  Mike and Jeanette Geno for their patience with me and hard work on behalf of  all who are blind or visually impaired, despite their own personal  challenges.  I have felt so much support from  our members as well.  I have met a lot of  great people and have many new friendships as a result of my time on the  executive board.  In a word, this has  been wonderful! </p>
    <p>     At our 2007 annual state convention we  will be electing three officers:  first  vice president, second vice president, and assistant treasurer.  Jim Moore has indicated his interest in running  again for second vice president.  Kyle  Austin has resigned his seat as assistant treasurer.  <br />
      It would be nice to see some competition  among the candidates, so I hope many of you will consider running for one of  these offices.  Although it is not  required, I have found my computer skills to be an indispensable part of my  work with MCBVI.  It would really help  the organization if the candidates could bring some computer skills with them  as there is a lot of clerical work that is necessary to keep everything on  track.  MCBVI could almost hire a person  part time for all of this.  I will be on  hand to teach people some of the clerical tricks I have learned if needed.</p>

    <p>                        Public Relations<br />
      Donna Rose, Chairperson</p>
    <p>     Soon I will be sending information out to  major newspapers in Michigan about MCBVI and your local chapters.  Remember, though, you are all public  relations agents for our organization.   It is always a good idea to publicize your local activities and chapter information.  I would recommend putting a phone number or  email address in your contact materials so people can contact you prior to  attending a meeting if they would like to know more details about your chapter.</p>
    <p>                           Resolutions<br />
      Chris Schumacher, Chairperson</p>
    <p>     In our last meeting it was decided to move  our deadline for submissions up to August 15th.   As of this writing, we have received no ideas from the membership.  Remember, you don't have to write a  resolution.  Just let us know what you  would like to see MCBVI work on in 2008.   Feel free to contact any committee member-Casey Dutmer, Neal Freeling,  Deb Wild, or myself-with your thoughts in Braille, by phone, or written in an  E-mail.  My E-mail address has changed  and is now: chrisanne7452@sbcglobal.net.<br />
      The deadline will be here before you know  it, so let us here from you.</p>

      Jeanette Geno, President</p>
    <p>     Happy Spring From the BWL.  In February our Blue Water League Of The  Blind organized transportation to and from the Winter Camp For The Blind hosted  by Battle Creek area Lions.  Next we held  a valentines dinner/dance where Good food and dancing was enjoyed by all.  During our regular meeting in March we  planned future programs and events.  In  April we put on our annual game night.  Visitors  from our sister chapter across the river in Canada, joined in on the fun and  snacks.  A regular business meeting is  scheduled in May, and in June we are planning an over night excursion to Lansing.<br />
      In our continuing partnership with the  Saint Clair County Library, we now hold a book discussion group called  &quot;the Book Talkers Club.&quot; We meet every three months. This club seeks  to integrate blind and sighted readers in our mutual reading enjoyment.<br />
      Our new brochure should be finished soon,  and members are encouraged to distribute it to doctors, ophthalmologists, and  post some at public service locations.   We make sure each member has copies to share with any interested person.<br />
      The BWL chapter meets the third Thursday  of most months. We usually start by 7 PM.   If you would like to join us please call (810) 982-0717 for more  details.</p>

    <p>     In June we will be going on an evening  oldies dinner cruise on the Michigan Princess.   It travels up and down the Grand River.   We are trying to raise the funds through local businesses to help defray  the costs and to be certain everyone can participate if they would like.  Also planned for summer will be an adaptive  game night where we all bring our blind-friendly games such as Braille scrabble,  UNO, and the like. <br />
      Our chapter is currently selling the  sharpest knives in America for a fundraiser.   Locally we are selling pairing knives and veggie peelers, and online  there are many more options from quick mixes, all types of kitchen knives and  cutlery, soy candles, recipe books, stoneware and much more.  The web address is: http://www.helpourfundraiser.com<br />
      At the prompt enter internet ordering  number 500706 and then password 6411.   You should use the www part of the address when using your web browser  to get to this web site.  The Capital  Area will receive a nice portion from all   sales.  These items make great  gifts for anyone and are very reasonably priced.      We are currently meeting at the Gone Wired  Café in Lansing.  For more details  regarding our meetings and activities contact Jim Moore at 517-374-8681.  </p>

    <p>     We recently had election of officers:  Thomas Lester, President, Rozella Campbell, Secretary, Jackie Ingram,  treasurer. We were sorry to loose Regina Wesley to  Kalamazoo, but happy she is in a new job at  the Kalamazoo training center for the blind.   We were happy to welcome new members: Beatrice Luckett, Eleanor Chaney,  Leo Mansfield and Ann Zimmerman. We are continuing to have &quot;Bingo&quot; on  a  monthly basis as one of our Fund  Raisers and looking forward to returning to &quot;Put-in-Bay', an evening on  the &quot;Princess Boat&quot; and Cedar Point. We invite anyone in  the Metro area to come and join us.<br />

    <p>     Our chapter did not meet in February due  to weather conditions and illness of some   members.  In March we all purchased  Tyrone Hamilton's music CD, and he told us that he will donate half of the proceeds  from all the albums he sells to our chapter.   Thanks so much, Tyrone!<br />
      In April we began discussing some  transportation concerns we have and how to work with some local providers.  Our meetings are held on the second Saturday  of the month.</p>
    <p>               Miscellaneous Items From The  Editor</p>
    <p>     The Muskegon chapter did not rejoin us  this year.  Chapters not included here  haven't submitted updates as of this publishing.  I did not receive a minutes summary to share  with you at this time.</p>
    <p>     We were sad to hear of the loss of  Elizabeth Lennon who was 97.  She spent  her life helping those who were blind teaching rehabilitation skills.  In her younger years she was extremely active  with our organization, both on a state and national level.  If someone can write a nice memoriam about her  for the summer newsletter please contact me.</p>
    <p>     Each quarter we would like to honor an  outstanding member of our affiliate.   Please submit nominations to me for the upcoming summer newsletter where  we will highlight this individual. Have members of your chapters submit letters  of support to me regarding a fantastic member of your group.  One person will be chosen from all  submissions for each newsletter.</p>
    <p>     Next newsletter deadline is July 24,  2007.  Please send all submissions for  publication by this date.  Thank you!</p>
    <p>                          Happy Spring!</p>

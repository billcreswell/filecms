<h3>History</h3>
<p>This current incarnation of this site is an adaptation of an old script that reads text files.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I thought it would be really simple to setup an ftp folder on a 
visually impaired persons desktop, and they could save a doc from their preferred
document editor as html right into the appropriate folder.</p>

<h3>Content Type in Folders</h3>
<p>Newsletters, Articles and Pages in separate folders, can be handled differenty</p>

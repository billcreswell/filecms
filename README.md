filecms
=======

An attempt to make a cms that works easily for folks, by dragging and dropping 
text, html or doc files for content.

Also an excuse to learn git, github.

The idea will be that the content editor will have ftp shortcuts setup on their 
desktop, and that will allow the contributor to upload newsletters in 
html/doc/rtf/text file, and the cms will create the appropriate links.

filecms
=======

An attempt to make a cms that works easily for folks, by dragging and dropping 
text, html or doc files for content.

Also an excuse to learn git, github.

The idea will be that the content editor will have ftp shortcuts setup on their 
desktop, and that will allow the contributor to upload newsletters in 
html/doc/rtf/text file, and the cms will create the appropriate links.

The site this was made for is blindmi.org.
I was hoping that it would be easy for them to convert newsletter word docs to text, and drop them in.

Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla all have accessibility teams, but seem to be overly complicated.
